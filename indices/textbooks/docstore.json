Many children and young adults spend most of their free time indoors watching TV and using smart phones, computers, and other electronic devices. Evidence indicates that such isolation from nature could be contributing to stress, anxiety, depression, irritability, difficulty in dealing with change, and excessive body weight. In the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 33% of all children and 69% of all adults over age 20 are overweight or obese. Also, the indoor air in U.S. homes and buildings is typically 2 to 5 times more polluted than outdoor air, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which could be contributing to the increasing incidence of certain lung ailments.\nNature-deficit disorder is partly an effect of \nurbanization. More than half of the world\u2019s people now live in urban areas, many of which do not have enough parks and recreational areas to make it easy for people to get out. Cities also have higher crime rates than do rural areas, and the continuous news cycle along with social networking keep people hyper-informed about crime and other threats. Thus, many people are afraid to venture out.\nResearch indicates that children and adults can gain \nmany benefits by playing and exploring outdoors, hiking, jogging, snorkeling (see cover photo), fishing, gardening, and bird-watching. Such activities can foster better health, reduce stress, improve mental abilities, and stimulate imagination and creativity. Experiencing nature can also provide a sense of wonder and connection to life on Earth, which keeps us alive and supports our economies.\nEnvironmental scientists have identified this \nincreasing isolation from nature as one of the five major causes of the environmental problems we face. Without an understanding of our utter dependence on nature for food, shelter, clean air, clean water, and many other natural resources and services, we become more likely to degrade our environment. With such an understanding, we will be more likely to reverse such degradation and to contribute positively to the environment and thus to our own well-being.\nJason Edwards/National Geographic Creative\n90446_fm_i-xxviii,1.indd   2 8/15/14   7:59 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

We believe that most people will still be able to live comfortable and fulfilling lives, and that societies will be more prosperous and peace-ful, when sustainability becomes one of the chief mea-sures by which personal choices and public policies are made. We consistently challenge students to work toward attaining such a future.\nFor this reason, we are happy to be working with the \nNational Geographic Society in the production of this book. This partnership has allowed us to include many stunning and informative photographs, numerous maps, and many new stories of National Geographic Explorers and other researchers who have received funding from National Geographic\u2014people who are making a posi-tive difference in the world. With these new tools, we continue to tell of the good news from various fields of environmental science, hoping to inspire young people to commit themselves to making our world a more sustain-able place to live for their own and future generations.\nWhat\u2019s New in This Edition?\n\u2022\tOur partnership with National Geographic has given us access to hundreds of amazing photographs, numerous maps, and inspiring stories of National Geographic Explorers and grantees\u2014people who are leading the way in environmental science, education, or entrepreneur -\nial enterprises.\n\u2022\t A\n\tstunning new design with a National Geographic look \nthat enhances visual learning.\n\u2022\tNew Core Case Studies for 10 of the book\u2019s 17 chapters bring important real-world stories to the forefront  \nfor use in applying those chapters\u2019 concepts and principles.\n\u2022\t New\n\tSupplement \t6,\tGeologic \tand\tBiological \tTime\t\nScale, that locates major developments related to life on Earth, including the mass extinctions, within the earth\u2019s geologic time scale.Sustainability Is the Integrating Theme of This Book\nSustainability is the overarching theme of this textbook.

To meet the diverse needs of hundreds of widely varying environmental science courses, we have designed a highly flexible book that allows instructors to vary the order of chapters without exposing students to terms and concepts that could confuse them. We recommend that instructors start with\n\tChapter\t1,\twhich\tdefines\tbasic\tterms\tand\tgives\tan\t\noverview of sustainability, population, pollution, resources, and economic development issues that are discussed throughout the book. This provides a spring-board for instructors to use the other chapters in almost any order. One often-used strategy is to follow Chapter\n\t1\twith\tChapters \t2\u20137,\twhich\tintroduce \tbasic\t\nscience and ecological concepts. Instructors can then use the remaining chapters in any order desired. Some instructors\n\tfollow\tChapter\t1\twith\tChapter\t17\ton\tenvi-\nronmental economics, politics, and worldviews, respectively, before proceeding to the chapters on basic science and ecological concepts. We provide a second level\n\tof\tflexibility \tin\tseven\tSupplements \t(see\tp.\txiii\tin\t\nthe\tDetailed\tContents), \twhich\tinstructors \tcan\tassign\tas\t\ndesired to meet their needs.

Why? First, there is overwhelming scientific evi-dence that we are in the process of seri-ously degrading our own life-support system. In other words, we are living unsustainably. Second, within your life-time we have the opportunity to learn how to live more sustainably by working with the rest of nature, as described in this book. \nI am fortunate to have three smart, \ntalented, and wonderful sons\u2014Greg, David, and Bill.

It is the overarching theme of this textbook.\nSince the mid-1980s, there has \nbeen a boom in environmental aware-ness on college campuses and in pub-lic and private schools around the world. In the United States, hundreds of colleges and universities have now taken the lead in a quest to become more sustainable and to educate their students about sustainability.\nFor example, at Oberlin College in \nOhio, a group of students worked with faculty members and architects to design a more sustainable environ-mental studies building (Figure 1.1) powered by solar panels, which pro-duce 30% more electricity than the building uses. Closed-loop under -\nground geothermal wells provide heating and cooling. In its solar green-house, a series of open tanks popu-lated by plants and other organisms purifies the building\u2019s wastewater. The building collects rainwater for irrigat-ing the surrounding grasses, gardens, and meadow, which contain a diver -\nsity of plant and animal species.\nBerea College in Kentucky boasts \nan innovative environmental science curriculum including a Sustainable Appalachian Communities course. The school also features its Ecovillage, a 50-unit experimental residence com-plex that uses passive solar heating, solar panels, and filtered rainwater.\nAt the University of California, \nSanta Cruz, in 2012, students reused, recycled, or composted more than 70% of their solid waste with a goal of reaching 100% by 2020. And in Ash-ville, North Carolina, Warren Wilson College gets more than a third of its food from regional farms, including its own large on-campus organic garden.\nIn addition to making campuses \ngreener, colleges are increasingly offer -\ning environmental sustainability courses and programs. At Pfeiffer University, many students have accompanied Pro-fessor Luke Dollar, a National Geo-graphic Emerging Explorer, on trips to \nMadagascar to take part in his research on that coun-try\u2019s endangered species and ecosystems. At the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, the Nelson Insti-tute for Environmental Studies seeks to integrate sustainability content throughout the academic departments, as well as to serve communities outside of the university.\nThese and many \nother institutions are educating students who will provide leadership in helping us to make our societies and economies more sustainable during the next few decades. Maybe you will join the ranks of such environ-mental leaders.\nThe Greening of American Campuses\n4 \nFIGURE 1.1  The Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio.\nRobb Williamson/NREL\n90446_ch01_002-023.indd   4 8/13/14   8:13 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

It includes the \nliving and the nonliving things (air, water, and energy) \nwith which we interact in a complex web of relationships that connect us to one another and to the world we live in. Despite our many scientific and technological ad-vances, we are utterly dependent on the earth for clean air and water, food, shelter, energy, fertile soil, and all other components of the planet\u2019s life-support system.\nThis textbook is an introduction to environmental \nscience, an interdisciplinary study of how humans interact with the living and nonliving parts of their environment. It integrates information and ideas from the natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, and geology; the social sciences such as geography, economics, and political science; and the humanities such as ethics. The three goals of environ-\nmental science are (1) to learn how life on the earth has survived and thrived, (2) to understand how we interact with the environment, and (3) to find ways to deal with environmental problems and live more sustainably.\nA key component of environmental science is ecol-\nogy, the biological science that studies how living things interact with one another and with their environment. These living things are called organisms. Each organism belongs to a species, a group of organisms that has a unique set of characteristics that distinguish it from other groups of organisms.\nA major focus of ecology is the study of ecosystems. An \necosystem is a set of organisms within a defined area of land or volume of water that interact with one another and with their environment of nonliving matter and en-ergy. For example, a forest ecosystem consists of plants (especially trees; see chapter-opening photo), animals, and various other organisms that decompose organic materi-als, all interacting with one another, with solar energy, and with the chemicals in the forest\u2019s air, water, and soil.\nWe should not confuse environmental science and \necology with environmentalism, a social movement dedicated to trying to sustain the earth\u2019s life-support sys-tems for all forms of life. Environmentalism is practiced more in the political and ethical arenas than in the realm of science. Environmentalism and environmental science are both being practiced vigorously on many college and university campuses (Core Case Study).\nThree Scientific Principles of Sustainability\nHow has the incredible variety of life on the earth been sustained for at least 3.8 billion years in the face of cata-strophic changes in environmental conditions? Such changes included gigantic meteorites impacting the earth, ice ages lasting for hundreds of millions of years, and long warming periods during which melting ice raised sea levels by hundreds of feet.\nThe latest version of our species has been around for \nonly about 200,000 years\u2014less than the blink of an eye, relative to the 3.8 billion years that life has existed on the planet (see the Geologic and Biological Time Scale in Supplement 6, p.

The earth receives a continuous supply of \nenergy from the sun, but it receives no new supplies of life-supporting chemicals. Thus through their complex interactions with their living and nonliving environment, organisms must continually recycle the chemicals they need in order to survive. This means that there is little waste in nature, other than in the human world, because the wastes and decayed bodies of any organism become nutrients or raw materials for other organisms. In nature,\nwaste = useful resources\nEcology and environmental science reveal that interde-\npendence, not independence, is what sustains life and allows it \nto adapt to a continually changing set of environmental conditions. Many environmental scientists argue that un-derstanding this interdependence is the key to learning how to live more sustainably.Sustainability Has Certain Key Components\nSustainability, the central integrating theme of this book, has several critical components that we use as subthemes. One such component is natural capital\u2014the natural resources and ecosystem services that keep us and other species alive and support human economies (Figure 1.3).\nNatural resources are materials and energy in na-\nture that are essential or useful to humans. They are often classified as inexhaustible resources (such as energy from the sun and wind), renewable resources (such as air, water, topsoil, plants, and animals) or nonrenewable or depletable resources (such as copper, oil, and coal).

Chemical cycling helps to turn wastes into resources. An important component of nutrient cycling is topsoil\u2014a vital natural resource that provides us and most other land-dwelling species with food. Without nutrient cycling in topsoil, life as we know it could not exist on the earth\u2019s land.\nNatural capital is also supported by energy from \nthe sun\u2014the focus of another of the scientific prin\u00ad\nciples of sustainability (Figure 1.2). Thus, our lives and economies depend on energy from the sun, and on natural resources and ecosystem services (natural capital) provided by the earth (Concept 1.1B).\nA second component of sustainability\u2014and another \nsubtheme of this text\u2014is to recognize that many human activities can degrade natural capital by using normally re-newable resources such as trees and topsoil faster than nature can restore them and by overloading the earth\u2019s normally renewable air and water systems with pollution and wastes. For example, in some parts of the world, we are replacing diverse and naturally sustainable forests (Figure 1.4) with crop plantations that can be sustained only with large inputs of water, fertilizer, and pesticides. We are also adding harmful chemicals and wastes to some rivers, lakes, and oceans faster than these bodies of water can cleanse themselves through natural processes. In addition, we are disrupting the nutrient cycles that support life because many of the plastics and other synthetic materials that we have created cannot be broken down and used as nutrients by other organisms.\nThis leads us to a third component of sustainability: \nsolutions. While environmental scientists search for scien-tific solutions to problems such as the degradation of for -\nests and other forms of natural capital, social scientists are looking for economic and political solutions. For example, Sustainability Has Certain Key Components\nSustainability, the central integrating theme of this book, has several critical components that we use as subthemes.

A scientific solution to the problem of pollution of rivers is to prevent the excessive dumping of harmful chemicals and wastes into streams and to allow them to recover naturally. However, to im-plement such solutions, governments often have to enact and enforce environmental laws and regulations.\nThe search for solutions often involves conflicts. For \nexample, when a scientist argues for protecting a long-undisturbed forest to help preserve its important biodiver -\nsity, the timber company that had planned to harvest the trees in that forest might protest. Dealing with such con-flicts often involves making trade-offs, or compromises\u2014another component of sustainability. For example, the timber company might be persuaded to plant and harvest trees in an area that it had already cleared or degraded, instead of clearing the undis-turbed forest. In return, the government might give the company a subsidy, or financial support, to meet some of the costs for planting the trees.\nIn making a shift toward sustainability, the \ndaily actions of each and every individual are im-portant. In other words, individuals matter\u2014an-other subtheme of this book. History shows that almost all of the significant changes in human systems that have improved environmental quality have come from the bottom up, through the col-lective actions of individuals and from individuals inventing more sustainable ways of doing things.\nOther Principles of Sustainability \nCome from the Social Sciences\nOur study of environmental problems, proposed \nsolutions, and trade-offs has led us to propose three social science principles of sustainability (Figure 1.5), derived from studies of eco-nomics, political science, and ethics:\n\u2022\n\t \tFull-cost pricing (from economics): Many \neconomists urge us to find ways to include the harmful environmental and health costs of producing and using goods and services in their market prices\u2014a practice called full-cost pricing. This would give consumers better information about the environmental impacts of their lifestyles, and it would allow them to make more informed choices about the goods and services they use.\n\u2022\n\t \tWin-win solutions (from political science): We can learn to work together in dealing with environmental problems by recognizing our interdependent connections with others and with our life-support system. This means shifting from a win-lose approach based on \ncompetition and dominance of other humans and of ecosystems to win-win solutions that are based on compromise in light of our interdependence and that benefit both people and the environment.\n\u2022\tA responsibility to future generations (from ethics): We should leave the planet\u2019s life-support systems in at least as good a condition as that which we now enjoy, if not better, for future generations.\nOther researchers have proposed additional sustain-\nability principles, but we believe that our six prin\u00ad\nciples of sustainability (Figure 1.2, Figure 1.5, and Supplement 7, pp. S50\u2013S51) can serve as key guidelines for helping us live more sustainably.\nThe clearing of vast areas of forest is an example \nof natural capital degradation.\nJohn Lee/Aurora Photos\nFIGURE 1.4  Small remaining area of once diverse Amazon rain forest surrounded \nby vast soybean fields in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso.\n90446_ch01_002-023.indd   8 8/13/14   8:13 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

On a time scale \nof millions to billions of years, geologic processes can re-new such resources. However, on the much shorter hu-man time scale, we can deplete these resources much faster than nature can form them. Such exhaustible stocks include energy resources such as oil and coal, metallic mineral \nresources such as copper and aluminum, and nonmetallic mineral resources such as salt and sand. As we deplete such resources, human ingenuity can often find substitutes. However, sometimes there is no acceptable or affordable substitute for a widely used nonrenewable resource.\nCountries Differ in Resource Use and \nEnvironmental Impact\nThe United Nations (UN) classifies the world\u2019s countries as \neconomically more developed or less developed, based primarily on their average income per person. More-\n \ndeveloped countries\u2014industrialized nations with high average income per person\u2014have 17% of the world\u2019s population and include the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, Germany, and most other European countries.\nAll other nations, in which 83% of the world\u2019s people \nlive, are classified as less-developed countries, most of them in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Some are middle-income, moderately developed countries such as China, India, Brazil, Thailand, and Mexico. Others are low-income, least-developed countries including Nigeria, Bangladesh, Congo, and Haiti. For a map of less-developed and more-developed countries see Figure 3, p.

Scientists also refer to this as natu-ral capital degradation.\nIn many parts of the world, renewable forests are \nshrinking (Figure 1.4), deserts are expanding, and topsoil is eroding. In addition, the lower atmosphere is warming, floating ice and some glaciers are melting at unexpected rates, sea levels are rising, ocean acidity is increasing, and floods, droughts, severe weather, and forest fires are more frequent in some areas. In a number of regions, rivers are running dry, harvests of many species of fish are dropping sharply, and coral reefs are dying. Species are becoming extinct at least 100 times faster than in pre-human times, and extinction rates are projected to increase by at least another 100-fold during this century.\nIn 2005, the UN released its Millennium Ecosystem Assess-\nment, a 4-year study by 1,360 experts from 95 countries.

The report\u2019s summary statement warned that \u201chuman activity is put-ting such a strain on the natural functions of Earth that the ability of the planet\u2019s ecosystems to sustain future genera-tions can no longer be taken for granted.\u201d The report also concluded that we have scientific, economic, and political solutions to these problems that we could implement within a few decades, as you will learn in reading this book.\nPollution Comes from a Number of Sources\nOne major environmental problem is pollution, which is contamination of the environment by any chemical or other agent such as noise or heat to a level that is harmful to the health, survival, or activities of humans or other organisms. Polluting substances, or pollutants, can enter the environment naturally, such as from volcanic erup-tions, or through human activities, such as the burning of coal and gasoline, and the dumping of chemicals into riv-ers, lakes, and oceans. At a high enough concentration in the air, in water, or in our bodies, almost any chemical can cause harm and be classified as a pollutant.\nThe pollutants we produce come from two types of \nsources. Point sources are single, identifiable sources. \nExamples are the smokestack of a coal-burning power or industrial plant (Figure 1.8), the drainpipe of a factory, and the exhaust pipe of an automobile. Nonpoint sources are dispersed and often difficult to identify. Examples are pes-ticides and particles of topsoil blown from the land into the air and the runoff of fertilizers, pesticides, and trash from the land into streams and lakes (Figure 1.9). It is much easier and less costly to identify and control or prevent pollution from point sources than from widely dispersed nonpoint sources.\nWe have tried to deal with pollution in two very differ -\nent ways. One approach is pollution cleanup, which involves cleaning up or diluting pollutants after we have produced them. For example, we can use tall smokestacks (Figure 1.8) to dilute and reduce the local effects of air pollutants. However, while tall smokestacks can reduce local air pollution they can increase air pollution in down-wind areas.\nThe other approach is pollution prevention, efforts \nfocused on greatly reducing or eliminating the production of pollutants. For example, we can enact pollution control laws that ban, or set low levels for, the emission of various pollutants into the atmosphere or into bodies of water.\nWe Are Degrading Commonly Shared \nRenewable Resources: The Tragedy of  the Commons\nSome renewable resources, known as open-access renewable \nresources, are not owned by anyone and can be used by almost anyone. Examples are the atmosphere, the open ocean and its fishes, and the earth\u2019s life-support system. Other examples of less open, but often shared resources, are 1.2 HOW ARE OUR ECOLOGICAL \nFOOTPRINTS AFFECTING THE EARTH?\nCONCEPT 1.2  As our ecological footprints grow, we are \ndepleting and degrading more of the earth\u2019s natural capital.\nWe Are Living Unsustainably\nAccording to a large and growing body of scientific evi-\ndence, we are living unsustainably by wasting, depleting, and degrading the earth\u2019s natural capital (Figure 1.3)\u2014a process known as environmental degradation, sum-marized in Figure 1.7.

Many of these renewable \nresources have been environmentally degraded. In 1968, biologist Garrett Hardin (1915\u20132003) called such degrada-tion the tragedy of the commons.\nDegradation of such shared or open-access renewable \nresources occurs because each user reasons, \u201cThe little bit that I use or pollute is not enough to matter, and anyway, it\u2019s a renewable resource.\u201d When the number of users is small, this logic works. Eventually, however, the cumula-tive effect of large numbers of people trying to exploit a widely available or shared resource can degrade it and eventually exhaust or ruin it. Then no one can benefit from it. That is the tragedy.\nOur Ecological Footprints Are Growing\nWhen people use renewable resources, it can result in natural capital degradation (Figure 1.7), pollution, and wastes. We can think of this harmful environmental impact as an ecological footprint\u2014the amount of land and wa-ter needed to supply a population or an area with renew-able resources and to absorb and recycle the wastes and pollution produced by such resource use. The per capita ecological footprint is the average ecological footprint of an individual in a given country or area. Figure 1.10 shows the human ecological impact in different parts of the world. (See Figure 6 in Supplement 4, p. S21, for the human eco-logical footprint in North America.)\nIf the total ecological footprint for a city, a country, or \nthe world is larger than its biological capacity to replenish its renewable resources and absorb the resulting wastes and pollution, it is said to have an ecological deficit. In other words, its people are living unsustainably by depleting natural capital instead of living off the renewable supply of resources and ecosystem services provided by such capital. Globally we are running up a huge ecological deficit, as shown by the map in Figure 4, p. S19, in Supplement 4. According to the 2013 Living Planet Report from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), we would need 1.5 planet Earths to indefinitely sustain the world\u2019s 2012 rate of total resource use.\nA relatively new school of thought, led by architect \nWilliam McDonough and scientist Michael Braungart, takes a slightly different approach to the notion of human environmental impacts and how to reduce them.

In other words, the goals of sustain-ability will be served by our working to create and expand our beneficial environmental impact. This is in keeping with the win-win principle of sustainability, and it is being demonstrated on many college and university campuses (Core Case Study).\nThroughout this book we discuss ways to use existing \nand emerging technologies and economic tools to reduce the size of our ecological footprints, while increasing our beneficial environmental impact.\nIPAT Is Another Environmental  \nImpact Model\nIn the early 1970s, scientists Paul Ehrlich and John Hold-\nren developed a simple model showing how population size (P), affluence (A), or wealth, as measured by rates of re-\nsource consumption per person, and the beneficial and harmful environmental effects of technologies (T) help to determine the environmental impact (I) of human activities. We can summarize this model by the simple equation:\nImpact (I) =  Population (P) \u00d7  Affluence (A) \u00d7  Technology (T)\nTable 1.1 shows the relative importance of these three \nfactors in selected high-, middle-, and low-income coun-tries. See Figure 3, p. S18, in Supplement 4 for a map comparing the world\u2019s high-, middle-, and low-income countries.\n While the ecological footprint model empha-\nsizes the use of renewable resources, the IPAT model in-cludes the environmental impact of using both renewable and nonrenewable resources.\nSome forms of technology such as polluting factories, \ngas-guzzling motor vehicles, and coal-burning power plants increase environmental impact by raising the harm-ful T factor. But other technologies reduce environmental impact by decreasing the T factor. Examples are pollution control and prevention technologies, fuel-efficient cars, and wind turbines and solar cells that generate electricity with a low environmental impact. These and newer tech-nologies to come can help us reduce our ecological foot-prints and expand our beneficial environmental impact.\n1.3 WHY DO WE HAVE \nENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS?\nCONCEPT 1.3A   Major causes of environmental problems \nare population growth, unsustainable resource use, poverty, \navoidance of full-cost pricing, and increasing isolation from nature.\nCONCEPT 1.3B   Our environmental worldviews play a key \nrole in determining whether we live unsustainably or more sustainably.ecological footprint is the average ecological footprint of \nan individual in a given country or area.

We discuss each of these causes in detail in later chapters of this book. Let us begin with a brief overview of them.\nThe Human Population Is Growing at a \nRapid Rate\nExponential growth occurs when a quantity such as the \nhuman population increases at a fixed percentage per unit of time, such as 0.5% or 2% per year. Exponential growth starts off slowly. But after only a few doublings, it grows to enormous numbers because each doubling is twice the total of all earlier growth.\nFor an example of the awesome power of exponential \ngrowth, consider a simple form of bacterial reproduction in which one bacterium splits into two every 20 minutes. Starting with one bacterium, after 20 minutes, there would be two; after an hour, there would be eight; ten hours later, there would be more than 1,000, and after just 36 hours (assuming that nothing interfered with their repro-duction), there would be enough bacteria to form a layer 0.3 meters (1 foot) deep over the entire earth\u2019s surface.\nThe human population has grown exponentially (Fig-\nure 1.12), and in 2013, the rate of growth was 1.2%. As a result, there are now about 7.1 billion people with about 85 million more people added each year. There could be 9.7 billion of us by 2050. This projected addition of 2.6 bil-lion more people within your lifetime is more than eight times the current U.S. population and almost twice that of China, the world\u2019s most populous nation.\nCONSIDER THIS \u2026\nCONNECTIONS Exponential Growth and Doubling \nTime: The Rule of 70\nThe doubling time of the human population or of any growing quantity can be \ncalculated by using the rule of 70: doubling time (years) = 70/annual growth rate (%). The world\u2019s population is growing at about 1.2% per year. At this rate how long will it take to double its size?\nNo one knows how many people the earth can support \nindefinitely, or at what level of average resource consump-\ntion per person, without seriously degrading the planet\u2019s life-support system. However, our large and expanding ecological footprints (Figure 1.10 and Figure 6, p. S21, in Supplement 4) and the resulting widespread natural capi-tal degradation are disturbing warning signs.\n Some scien-\ntists argue that we could control such severe degradation by slowing population growth with the goal of having it level off at around 8 billion by 2050. We examine the pos-sible ways to do this in Chapter 6.\nAffluence Has Harmful and Beneficial \nEnvironmental Effects\nThe lifestyles of the world\u2019s expanding population of con-\nsumers are built on growing affluence as more people achieve higher incomes. This results in higher levels of total and per capita resource consumption along with more environmental degradation, waste, and pollution.\nThese results can be dramatic. The WWF has estimated \nthat the United States is responsible for almost half of the global ecological footprint. The average American con-sumes about 30 times the amount of resources that the average Indian consumes and 100 times the amount con-FIGURE 1.11  Environmental and social scientists have identified five basic causes of the environmental \nproblems we face (Concept 1.3A).

As a result, the WWF projected that we would need 5 planet Earths to indefinitely sustain the rate of resource use of the average American.\nThe problem is that providing such resources contrib-\nutes to air pollution and water pollution from factories and motor vehicles and land degradation from the mining of raw materials used to make the products we consume. Another downside to wealth is that it allows affluent con-sumers to obtain their resources from almost anywhere in the world without seeing the harmful effects of their high-consumption lifestyles.\nOn the other hand, affluence can allow for more wide-\nspread and better education, which can lead people to become more concerned about environmental quality. Af-fluence can also make more money available for develop-ing technologies to reduce pollution, environmental degradation, and resource waste along with other ways to increase our beneficial environmental impact.\nAs a result, in the United States and most other afflu-\nent countries, the air is clearer, drinking water is purer, and most rivers and lakes are cleaner than they were in the 1970s. In addition, the food supply is more abundant and safer, the incidence of life-threatening infectious diseases has been greatly reduced, life spans are longer, and some endangered species are being rescued \nGOOD\nNEWSfrom extinction hastened by human activities. These im-\nprovements were largely financed by affluence.\nPoverty Can Have Harmful Environmental \nand Health Effects\nPoverty is a condition in which people are unable to fulfill \ntheir basic needs for adequate food, water, shelter, health care, and education. According to the World Bank, about 900 million people\u2014almost three times the U.S. popula-tion\u2014live in extreme poverty, struggling to live on the equiva-lent of less than $1.25 a day, which is less than what many people spend for a bottle of water or a cup of coffee. About one of every three, or 2.6 billion, of the world\u2019s people struggles to live on less than $2.25 a day. Could you do this?\nPoverty can cause a number of harmful environmental \nand health effects. The daily lives of the world\u2019s poorest people are focused on getting enough food, water, and cooking and heating fuel to survive. Desperate for short-term survival, these individuals do not have the luxury of worrying about long-term environmental quality or sus-tainability. Thus, collectively, they can degrade forests, topsoil, and grasslands, and deplete fisheries and wildlife populations in order to stay alive.\nHowever, poverty does not necessarily lead to environ-\nmental degradation.

Their chil-\ndren help them gather firewood, haul water, and tend crops and livestock. The children also help to care for their aging parents, most of whom do not have social security, health care, and retirement funds. This daily struggle for survival is largely why populations in some of the poorest countries continue to grow at high rates.\nEnvironmental degradation can have severe health ef-\nfects on poor people. One such problem is life-threatening \nmalnutrition, a lack of protein and other nutrients needed for good health (Figure 1.13), resulting from environmen-tal degradation that interferes with food production.\nAnother such effect is illness caused by limited access to \nadequate sanitation facilities and clean drinking water. About one of every eight of the world\u2019s people get water for drinking, washing, and cooking from sources polluted by human and animal feces. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution also threatens millions of peo-ple in less-developed countries. Outdoor air pollution causes more than 1 million deaths per year in China, and worldwide, about 4.3 million people are killed every year by indoor air pollution, mostly smoke from open fires or poorly vented stoves used for heating and cooking.CONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT The Poor, the Affluent, and Rapidly \nIncreasing Population Growth\nSome see the rapid population growth in less-developed countries as the pri-\nmary cause of our environmental problems. Others say that the high rate of resource use per person in more-developed countries is a more important fac-tor. Which factor do you think is more important? Why?\nPrices of Goods and Services Rarely  \nInclude Their Harmful Environmental and Health Costs\nAnother basic cause of environmental problems has to do \nwith how goods and services are priced in the market-place. Companies using resources to provide goods for consumers generally are not required to pay for most of the harmful environmental and health costs of supplying such goods. For example, timber companies pay the cost of clear-cutting forests but do not pay for the resulting envi-ronmental degradation and loss of wildlife habitat. The primary goal of a company is to maximize profits for its owners or stockholders, so it is not inclined to add these costs to its prices voluntarily. Because the prices of goods and services do not include most of their harmful environ-mental and health costs, consumers and decision makers have no effective way to evaluate these harmful effects.\nAnother problem can arise when governments (tax-\npayers) give companies subsidies such as tax breaks and payments to assist them with using resources to run their businesses. This helps to create jobs and stimulate econo-mies, but environmentally harmful subsidies encourage the depletion and degradation of natural capital. (See the online Guest Essay by Norman Myers on this topic.)\nWe could live more sustainably and increase our ben-\neficial environmental impact by finding ways to include in market prices the harmful environmental and health costs of the goods and services that we use. Such full-cost pric-ing is the basis for one of the three social science \nprinciples of sustainability. Two ways to do this over the next two decades would be to shift from environ-mentally harmful government subsidies to environmen-tally beneficial subsidies, and to tax pollution and waste heavily while reducing taxes on income and wealth. We discuss such subsidy shifts and tax shifts in Chapter 17.\nWe Are Increasingly Isolated from Nature\nToday, more than half of the world\u2019s", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3992, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f272a88-dc56-4906-9140-252828d676c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f272a88-dc56-4906-9140-252828d676c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "G.

Similarly, many people are unaware of the amounts of wastes and pollutants they produce, where these wastes and pollutants go, and how they affect the en-vironment. Some analysts ask: How will we live more sus-tainably by shrinking our ecological footprints and expanding our beneficial environmental impact, if we do not appreciate the beauty and importance of nature and understand that we are utterly dependent on the earth\u2019s natural systems and the natural capital they provide? Some environmental lead-ers are focusing on this problem (Individuals Matter 1.1).\nPeople Have Different Views about \nEnvironmental Problems and  Their Solutions\nPeople differ over the nature and seriousness of the world\u2019s \nenvironmental problems and over what we should do to help solve them, and these disagreements arise mostly be-cause of differing environmental worldviews. Your environ-mental worldview is your set of assumptions and values reflecting how you think the world works and what you think your role in the world should be. Environmental ethics, the study of varying beliefs about what is right and wrong with how we treat the environment, provides useful tools for examining worldviews. For example, here are some important ethical questions relating to the environment:\n\u2022\t Why\n\tshould\twe\tcare\tabout\tthe\tenvironment?\n\u2022\t Are\twe\tthe\tmost\timportant \tspecies\ton\tthe\tplanet\tor\tare\t\nwe just another one of the earth\u2019s millions of different forms of life?\n\u2022\t Do\n\twe\thave\tan\tobligation \tto\tsee\tthat\tour\tactivities \tdo\t\nnot cause the extinction of other species? If so, should we try to protect all species or only some? How do we decide which to protect?\n\u2022\t Do\n\twe\thave\tan\tethical\tobligation \tto\tpass\tthe\tnatural\t\nworld on to future generations in a condition that is as good as or better than what we inherited?\n\u2022\t Should\n\tevery\tperson\tbe\tentitled\tto\tequal\tprotection \t\nfrom environmental hazards regardless of race, gender, age, national origin, income, social class, or any other factor? (This is the central ethical and political issue for \nJuan Martinez\u2014Working to Reconnect People with Nature\nNational Geographic Emerging Explorer Juan Martinez learned first-hand about the value of \nconnecting with nature, and now he spends his time working to pass along his experience and knowledge of that value to others, particularly to disadvantaged youths.\nMartinez grew up in a poor area of Los Angeles, California, where as a boy he was in dan -\nger of becoming absorbed by a gang culture. One of his teachers recognized Martinez\u2019s po -\ntential and gave him a chance to pass a class that he was failing by joining the school\u2019s Eco Club. Martinez took that opportunity and when the club planned a field trip to see the Grand Teton Mountains of Wyoming, he jumped at the chance. As a result, he says, \u201cI still can\u2019t find words to describe the first moment I saw those mountains rising up from the valley. Watching bison, seeing a sky full of stars, and hiking through that scenery was overwhelming.\u201d\nThe experience transformed Martinez\u2019s life. Today, he spearheads the Natural Leaders \nNetwork of the Children & Nature Network, an organization creating links between envi-\nronmental organizations, corporations, government, education, and individuals to reconnect children with nature. His work as an environmental leader has inspired many others to do similar work.\nMartinez has received a great deal of recognition for his efforts, including invitations to White House forums on environmental \neducation. His greatest reward, however, is in seeing how his efforts help others.

Compare your answers \nwith those of your classmates. Record your answers and, at the end of this course, return to these questions to see if your answers have changed.\nPeople with widely differing environmental worldviews \ncan take the same data, be logically consistent with it, and \narrive at quite different answers to such questions because they start with different assumptions and moral, ethical, or religious beliefs. Environmental worldviews are discussed in detail in Chapter 17, but here is a brief introduction.\nThere are three major categories of environmental \nworldviews: human-centered, life-centered, and earth-centered. A human-centered environmental world-view sees the natural world primarily as a support system for human life. One such worldview, the planetary manage-ment worldview, holds that humans are separate from and in charge of nature and that we can manage the earth mostly for our benefit, into the distant future. Another is the stewardship worldview, which holds that we can and \nshould manage the earth for our benefit, but that we have an ethical responsibility to be caring and responsible man-agers, or stewards, of the earth.\nAccording to the life-centered environmental \nworldview, all species have value as participating mem-bers of the biosphere, regardless of their potential or actual use to humans. Most people with a life-centered world-view believe we have an ethical responsibility to avoid hastening the extinction of species through our activities.\nThe earth-centered environmental worldview \nholds that we are part of, and dependent on, nature and that the earth\u2019s life-support system exists for all species, not just for us. According to this view, our economic suc-cess and the long-term survival of our cultures and our species depend on learning how life on the earth has sus-tained itself for billions of years and integrating such les-sons from nature into the ways we think and act.\nThe Rise of Environmental Conservation \nand Protection in the United States\nEuropean colonists arriving in the early 1600s viewed \nNorth America as a continent with seemingly inexhaust-ible resources and as a wilderness to be conquered and managed for human use. As the colonists spread across the continent, they cleared forests for cropland and settle-ments, plowed up grasslands to plant crops, and mined gold, lead, and other minerals.In 1864, George Perkins Marsh, a scientist and member \nof Congress from Vermont, questioned the idea that the country\u2019s resources were inexhaustible. He also used scien-tific studies and case studies to show how the rise and fall of past civilizations were linked to the use and misuse of their soils, water supplies, and other resources. Thus he was one of the founders of the U.S. conservation movement.\nEarly in the 20th century, this movement split into two \nfactions with differing views over how public lands should be used. The preservationist school, led by naturalist John Muir (Figure 1.14), wanted wilderness areas on some pub-lic lands to be left untouched. The conservationist school, led \nby Teddy Roosevelt (Figure 1.15) and Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service, believed all public lands should be managed wisely and scientifically, primar -\nily to provide resources for people.\nU.S. conservation efforts continued to straddle these \ntwo schools of thought, and Aldo Leopold (Figure 1.16), wildlife manager, professor, writer, and conservationist, personified this dual", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3874, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b36e3d6f-f8fe-4740-8e87-f1b3e257ea33": {"__data__": {"id_": "b36e3d6f-f8fe-4740-8e87-f1b3e257ea33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "G.

In 1935, he helped to found the U.S. Wilderness Society. Largely through his writings, especially his 1949 book A Sand County Almanac, he laid the groundwork for the field of environ-mental ethics. He contended that the role of the human species should be to protect nature, not to conquer it.\nLater in the 20th century, it became necessary to \nbroaden the concept of resource conservation to include \nFIGURE 1.14  As leader of the preservationist movement, John Muir \n(1838\u20131914) called for setting aside some of the country\u2019s public \nlands as protected wilderness, an idea that was not enacted into law until 1964.

One prominent pioneer in that effort was biologist Rachel Carson (Figure 1.17), who in 1962 wrote Silent Spring, which documented the pollution of air, wa-ter, and wildlife from the use of harmful pesticides such as DDT. This influential book heightened public awareness of pollution problems, which led to the regulation of danger -\nous pesticides.\nBetween 1940 and 1970, the United States underwent \nrapid economic growth and industrialization. The by-products were increasing pollution of air and water and growing mounds of solid and hazardous wastes. Air pollu-tion got so bad in many industrial cities that drivers had to use their car headlights during the daytime, and many thousands died each year from the harmful effects of air pollution. A stretch of the Cuyahoga River running through Cleveland, Ohio, was so polluted with oil and other flam-mable pollutants that it caught fire several times. And there was a devastating oil spill off the California coast in 1969. In addition, well-known wildlife species such as the American bald eagle, the grizzly bear, the whooping crane, and the peregrine falcon became endangered.\nGrowing publicity over these problems led the Ameri-\ncan public to demand government action. When the first Earth Day was held on April 20, 1970, some 20 million people in more than 2,000 U.S. communities and college and university campuses (Core Case Study) took to the streets to demand improvements in environmental qual-ity. This led to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970 and to passage of most of the U.S. environmental laws now in place during the 1970s\u2014known as the decade of the environment.\nIn the 1980s there was a backlash against environmen-\ntal laws and regulations, led by some corporate leaders and members of Congress who argued that environmental laws were hindering economic growth. Since 1990, lead-ers and supporters of the environmental movement have had to spend much of their time and resources fighting efforts to discredit the movement and to weaken or elimi-nate most environmental laws passed during the 1970s.\nFIGURE 1.15  Effective protection of forests and wildlife on federal \nlands did not begin until Theodore (Teddy) roosevelt (1858\u20131919) be-\ncame president. his term of office, 1901\u20131909, has been called the \ncountry\u2019s Golden Age of Conservation. he established 36 national \nwildlife reserves and more than tripled the size of the national forest \nreserves.\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\nFIGURE 1.16  Aldo Leopold (1887\u20131948) became a leading conser -\nvationist and his book, A Sand County Almanac, is considered an en-vironmental classic that helped to inspire the modern conservation and environmental movements.

Interest in environmental issues grew on many college and university campuses, resulting in the expan-sion of environmental studies courses and programs (Core Case Study). In addition, there came a growing awareness of critical, complex, and largely invisible environmental issues, including losses in biodiversity, aquifer depletion, ocean pollution and acidification, and atmospheric warm-ing and the threat of climate disruption.\nIn the 1970s, the United States led the world in envi-\nronmental awareness, wildlife conservation, and environ-mental protection. Some analysts point to this fact and call for new U.S. leadership in dealing with these larger and less visible long-term threats and in finding paths toward more environmentally sustainable societies and economies.\n1.4 WHAT IS AN \nENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE SOCIETY?\nCONCEPT 1.4   Living sustainably means living off the \nearth\u2019s natural income without depleting or degrading the \nnatural capital that supplies it.\nEnvironmentally Sustainable Societies \nProtect Natural Capital and Live Off  Its Income\nAccording to most environmental scientists, our ultimate \ngoal should be to achieve an environmentally sustainable society\u2014one that meets the current and future basic re-source needs of its people in a just and equitable manner without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their basic resource needs. This is in keeping with the future generations principle of sustainability.\nImagine that you win $1 million in a lottery. Suppose \nyou invest this money (your capital) and earn 10% inter -\nest per year. If you live on just the interest, or the income made by your capital, you will have a sustainable annual income of $100,000 that you can spend each year indefi-nitely without depleting your capital. However, if you consistently spend more than your income, you will de-plete your capital. Even if you spend just $110,000 per year while still allowing the interest to accumulate, your money will be gone within 18 years.\nThe lesson here is an old one: Protect your capital and live \non the income it provides. Deplete or waste your capital and you will move from a sustainable to an unsustainable lifestyle.\nThe same lesson applies to our use of the earth\u2019s natural \ncapital (Figure 1.3)\u2014the global trust fund of free natural resources and ecosystem services that nature has provided for us, for future generations, and for the earth\u2019s other spe-cies. Living sustainably means living on natural income, \nthe renewable resources such as plants, animals, soil, clean air, and clean water, provided by the earth\u2019s natural capital. By working to preserve and replenish the earth\u2019s natural capital, which supplies this income, we can find the best ways to reduce our ecological footprints while expanding our beneficial environmental impact (Concept 1.4).\nA More Sustainable Future Is Possible\nMaking a shift toward a more sustainable future will in-volve some tough challenges. Ecologists note that, given enough time, nature can recover from many of our envi-ronmentally harmful impacts. However, natural recovery can take hundreds to thousands of years, while harmful human impacts are expanding exponentially within a time period of 10 to 100 years. Thus, in learning to live more sustainably, time is our most scarce resource.\nHere are two pieces of good news: First, research by \nsocial scientists suggests that it takes only 5\u201310% of the population of a community, a country, or the world to bring about major social and environmental change. Second, such research also shows that such change can occur in a much shorter time than most people think. Anthropologist Margaret Mead summarized our potential for social change: \u201cNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.

Define sustainability, and summarize the story of \nhow many college campuses are working to become \nmore environmentally sustainable.\nSection 1.1\n 2. What are the three key concepts for this section? Define environment. Distinguish among environ-\nmental science, ecology, and environmentalism. \nDistinguish between an organism and a species. What is an ecosystem? What are three scientific princi-ples of sustainability derived from how the natural world works? What is solar energy and why is it im-portant to life on the earth? What is biodiversity and why is it important to life on the earth? Define nutri-ents. Define chemical cycling (or nutrient cycling) and explain why it is important to life on the earth.\n 3. Define natural capital. Define natural resources  \nand ecosystem services, and give two examples of \neach. Give three examples of how we are degrading natural capital. Explain how finding solutions to en-vironmental problems involves making trade-offs. Explain why individuals matter in dealing with the environmental problems we face. What are three social science principles of sustainability? What is full-cost pricing and why is it important?\n 4. What is a resource? Distinguish between an inex-haustible resource and a renewable resource and give an example of each. What is the sustainable yield of a renewable resource? Define and give two examples of a nonrenewable or exhaustible re-source. Distinguish between more-developed countries and less-developed countries and give one example each of a high-income, middle-income, and low-income country.\nSection 1.2\n 5. What is the key concept for this section? Define and give three examples of environmental degrada-tion (natural capital degradation). About what percentage of the earth\u2019s natural or ecosystem ser -\nvices have been degraded by human activities? De-fine pollution. Distinguish between point sources  \nand nonpoint sources of pollution and give an ex-\nample of each. Distinguish between pollution cleanup and pollution prevention and give an ex-ample of each. What is the tragedy of the commons?\n 6. What is an ecological footprint? What is a per capita ecological footprint? Use the ecological footprint concept to explain how we are living unsus-tainably. What is meant by upcycling? What is the IPAT model for estimating our environmental impact?\nWe opened this chapter  with a Core \nCase Study about college students around the United States \nwho are working to address many of the serious environmen-tal problems we face and to improve environmental quality on their campuses. Thousands of students on campuses all over the world are doing the same. Many of these students are learning that a key to most solutions is to apply the three scientific principles of sustainability  \n(Figure 1.2) and the three social science principles of sustainability (Figure 1.5) to the design of our economic and social  \nsystems, and to our individual lifestyles. \nWe can use such strategies to try to slow \nthe rapidly expanding losses of biodiversity, to sharply reduce our production of wastes and pollution, to switch to more sustainable sources of energy, and to promote more sustainable forms of agriculture and other uses of land and water. We can also use these principles to sharply reduce poverty and slow human population growth.\nYou and all of your fellow students have \nthe good fortune to be members of the 21st century\u2019s transition generation that will play a \nmajor role in deciding whether humanity cre-ates a more sustainable future or continues on a path toward further environmental deg-radation and disruption. This means confront-ing the urgent challenges presented by the major environmental problems discussed in this book. It is an incredibly exciting and chal-lenging time to be alive as we struggle to de-velop a more sustainable relationship with this planet that is our only home.TyING IT All TOGET hER\nThe Greening", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3979, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e19e524-f4ac-49b2-9f3d-6a66df7d31c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e19e524-f4ac-49b2-9f3d-6a66df7d31c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "G.

You are very concerned and want to know about the possible harmful environmental effects of  \nthis action.\nOne way to learn about such \neffects is to conduct a controlled experiment, just as environmental sci-entists do. They begin by identifying key variables, such as water loss and \nsoil nutrient content, that might change after the trees are cut down. Then, they set up two groups. One is the experimental group, in which a \nchosen variable is changed in a known way. The other is the control group, in which the chosen variable is not changed. They then compare the results from the two groups.\nIn 1963, botanist F. Herbert Bor -\nmann, forest ecologist Gene Likens, and their colleagues began carrying out such a controlled experiment. Their goal was to compare the loss of water and soil nutrients from an area of uncut forest (the control site) with one that had been stripped of its trees (the experimental site).\nThey built V-shaped concrete dams \nacross the creeks at the bottoms of several forested valleys in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire (Figure 2.1). The dams were designed so that all surface water leaving each forested valley had to flow across a dam, where scientists could measure its volume and dis-solved nutrient content.\nFirst, the researchers measured the \namounts of water and dissolved soil nutrients flowing from an undisturbed forested area in one of the valleys (the control site) (Figure 2.1, left). These measurements showed that an undis-turbed mature forest is very efficient at storing water and retaining chemi-cal nutrients in its soils.\nNext, they set up an experimental \nforest area in a nearby valley (Figure 2.1, right). One winter, they cut down all the trees and shrubs in that valley, left them where they fell, and sprayed the area with herbicides to prevent the regrowth of vegetation. Then, for 3 years, they compared outflow of water and nutrients in this experimen-tal site with those in the control site.\nThe scientists found that, with no \nplants to help absorb and retain water, the amount of water flowing out of the deforested valley increased by 30\u201340%. As this excess water ran rap-idly over the ground, it eroded soil and carried dissolved nutrients out of the topsoil in the deforested site. Overall, the loss of key soil nutrients from the experimental forest was six to eight times that in the nearby uncut control forest.\nIn this chapter, you will learn more \nabout how scientists study nature and about the matter and energy that make up the world within and around us. You will also learn about three sci-entific laws, or rules of nature, that govern the changes that matter and energy undergo. And you will learn the important difference between a scien-tific hypothesis and a scientific theory.\nHow Do Scientists Learn about Nature? Experimenting with a Forest\n26 \nFIGURE 2.1  This controlled field experiment measured the loss of water and soil nutrients from a forest due to \ndeforestation.

It is based on the as-sumption that events in the physical world follow orderly cause-and-effect patterns that can be understood through careful observation, measurements, and experimentation. Figure 2.2 summarizes the scientific process.\nIn this chapter\u2019s Core Case Study, experimenters Bor -\nmann and Likens carried out this scientific process to find out how clearing forested land can affect its ability to store water and retain soil nutrients. They designed an experi-ment to collect data, or information, to answer their ques-tion (Figure 2.1). They then proposed a scientific hypothesis\u2014a possible and testable explanation of the data. Bormann and Likens came up with the following hypothesis to explain their data: When a forest is cleared of its vegetation and exposed to rain and melting snow, it retains less water and loses large quantities of soil nutri-ents. They tested this hypothesis for the soil nutrient nitro-gen and then repeated their controlled experiment for phosphorus.\nThe experimenters wrote scientific articles describing \ntheir research and these were evaluated by other scientists in their fields. These reviews and further research by other scientists supported their results and hypothesis. Another way to test projections is to develop a model, an approxi-\nmate representation or simulation of a system. Data from the research carried out by Bormann and Likens and from other scientists\u2019 research was fed into such models, which also supported their research.\nA well-tested and widely accepted scientific hypothesis \nor a group of related hypotheses is called a scientific theory. The research conducted by Bormann and Likens and other scientists led to the scientific theory that trees and other plants hold soil in place and help it to retain water and nutrients needed to support the plants.\nScientists Are Curious and Skeptical and \nDemand Evidence\nGood scientists are extremely curious about how nature \nworks and are keen observers of what is happening in nature (see Individuals Matter 2.1). Scientists tend to be highly skeptical of new data and hypotheses. They say, \u201cShow me your evidence and explain the reasoning be-hind the scientific ideas or hypotheses that you propose to explain your data.\u201d\nAn important part of the scientific process is peer re-\nview. It involves scientists openly publishing details of the methods they used, the results of their experiments, and the reasoning behind their hypotheses for other scientists working in the same field (their peers) to evaluate. Scien-tific knowledge advances in this self-correcting way, with scientists continually questioning and checking the data and hypotheses of their peers.\nFIGURE 2.2  The general process that scientists use for discovering \nand testing ideas about how the natural world works.\n\u00a9 Cengage LearningScienti/f_ic law\nWell-accepted \npattern in data\nScienti/f_ic theory\nWell-tested and \nwidely accepted \nhypothesisAccept \nhypothesisRevise \nhypothesisPerform an experiment\nto test projectionsUse hypothesis to make \ntestable projectionsPropose a hypothesis \nto explain dataAnalyze data\n(check for patterns)Perform an experiment \nto answer the question \nand collect dataAsk a question to be \ninvestigatedFind out what is known \nabout the problem \n(literature search)Identify a problem\nTest \nprojectionsMake testable \nprojections\n90446_ch02_024-039.indd   27 8/13/14   8:18 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

She is also a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Emeritus. At age 26, she \nbegan a more-than-50-year career of studying chimpanzee social and family life in the Gombe Stream Game Reserve in what is now the African country of Tanzania.\nOne of her major scientific discoveries was that chimpanzees make and use tools. \nShe observed some chimpanzees modifying twigs or blades of grass and then poking them into termite mounds. When the termites latched on to these primitive tools, the chimpanzees pulled them out and ate the termites. Goodall and several other scientists have also observed that chimpanzees, including captive chimpanzees, can learn simple sign language, do simple arithmetic, play computer games, develop relationships, and worry about and protect one another.\nIn 1977, she established the Jane Goodall Institute, an organization that works to \npreserve great ape populations and their habitats. In 1991 Goodall started \nRoots & Shoots,  an environmental education program \nfor youth that is active in more than 130 countries. She has received many awards and prizes for her scientific contributions and conservation efforts and has written 27 books for adults and children and has been involved with more than 15 films about the lives and importance of chimpanzees.\nGoodall spends nearly 300 days a year traveling and educating people throughout the world about chimpanzees and the need \nto protect the environment. She says, \u201cI can\u2019t slow down. . . .

Thinking criti-\ncally involves four important steps:\n1. Be skeptical about everything you read or hear.\n2. Look at the evidence and evaluate it and any related \ninformation, along with inputs and opinions from a variety of reliable sources.\n3.\n Be open to many viewpoints and evaluate each one before coming to a conclusion.\n4.\n Identify and evaluate your personal assumptions, biases, and beliefs, being careful to distinguish between facts and opinions.\nLogic and critical thinking are very important tools in \nscience, but imagination, creativity, and intuition are just \nas vital. According to physicist Albert Einstein, \u201cThere is no completely logical way to a new scientific idea.\u201dScientific Theories and Laws Are the Most \nImportant and Certain Results of Science\nWe should never take a scientific theory lightly. It has been \ntested widely, is supported by extensive evidence, and is accepted as being a useful explanation of some phenome-non by most scientists in a particular field or related fields of study. So when you hear someone say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just a theory,\u201d you will know that he or she does not have a clear understanding of what a scientific theory is.\nAnother important and reliable outcome of science is a \nscientific law, or law of nature\u2014a well-tested and widely accepted description of what we find happening repeatedly and in the same way in nature. An example is the law of gravity. After making many thousands of obser -\nvations and measurements of objects falling from different heights, scientists developed the following scientific law: all objects fall to the earth\u2019s surface at predictable speeds.\nWe can break a society\u2019s law, for example, by driving \nfaster than the speed limit.

Scientific hypotheses and results that are pre-sented as reliable without having undergone the rigors of peer review, or that have been discarded as a result of peer review or additional research, are considered to be unreli-able science.\nPreliminary scientific results that have not been widely \ntested and accepted by peer review or tested and repro-duced by other scientists are not yet considered to be reli-able, and can be thought of as tentative science. Some of these results and hypotheses will be validated and classi-fied as reliable and some will be discredited and classified as unreliable. This is how scientific knowledge advances.\nScience Has Some Limitations\nEnvironmental science and science in general have four important limitations. First, scientists cannot prove or dis-prove anything absolutely, because there is always some degree of uncertainty in scientific measurements, observa-tions, and models. Instead, scientists try to establish that a particular scientific theory has a very high probability or \ncertainty (typically 90% to 95%) of being useful for under -\nstanding some aspect of the natural world.\nMany scientists do not use the word proof because it \nimplies \u201cabsolute proof\u201d to many. For example, most scien-tists will rarely say something like, \u201cWe have proven that cigarettes cause lung cancer.\u201d Rather, they might say, \u201cOverwhelming evidence from thousands of studies indi-cates that people who smoke regularly for many years have a greatly increased chance of developing lung cancer.\u201d\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Scientific Proof\nDoes the fact that science can never prove anything absolutely mean that its \nresults are not valid or useful? Explain.\nA second limitation of science is that scientists are hu-\nman and thus are not totally free of bias about their own \nresults and hypotheses. However, the high standards of evidence required through peer review can help to un-cover or greatly reduce personal bias and expose occa-sional cheating by scientists who falsify their results.\nA third limitation is that many systems in the natural \nworld involve a huge number of variables with complex interactions. This makes it too difficult, costly, and time consuming to test one variable at a time in controlled ex-periments such as the one described in this chapter\u2019s Core Case Study. To deal with this problem, scientists develop mathematical models that can take into account the interac-\ntions of many variables, and they run such models on high-speed computers.\nA fourth limitation of science involves the use of statis-\ntical tools. For example, there is no way to measure ac-curately how many metric tons of soil are eroded annually worldwide. Instead, scientists use statistical sampling and mathematical methods to estimate such numbers.\nDespite these limitations, science is the most useful way \nthat we have of learning about how nature works and pro-jecting how it might behave in the future. But we still know too little about how the earth works, about its present state of environmental health, and about the likely current and future environmental impacts of our activities.\n2.2 WHAT IS MATTER AND WHAT \nHAPPENS WHEN IT UNDERGOES CHANGE?\nCONCEPT 2.2A   Matter consists of elements and com-\npounds, which in turn are made up of atoms, ions, or \nmolecules.\nCONCEPT 2.2B   Whenever matter undergoes a physical or \nchemical change, no atoms are created or destroyed (the law of conservation of matter).\nMatter Consists of Elements and \nCompounds\nMatter is anything that has mass and takes up space.

Table 2.1 lists the \nelements and their symbols that you need to know to understand the material in this book.\nMost matter consists of compounds, combinations of \ntwo or more different elements held together in fixed pro-portions. For example, water is a compound made of the elements hydrogen and oxygen that have chemically com-bined with one another.\nAtoms, Molecules, and Ions Are the \nBuilding Blocks of Matter\nThe basic building block of matter is an atom, the smallest \nunit of matter into which an element can be divided and still have its distinctive chemical properties. The idea that all elements are made up of atoms is called the atomic theory and it is the most widely accepted scientific theory in chemistry.\nAtoms are incredibly small. For example, more than 3 \nmillion hydrogen atoms could sit side by side on the period at the end of this sentence. If you could view atoms with a supermicroscope, you would find that each different type of atom contains a certain number of three types of subatomic particles: neutrons, with no electrical charge; \nprotons, each with a positive electrical charge (+); and electrons, each with a negative electrical charge (\u2212).\nEach atom has an extremely small center called the \nnucleus, which contains one or more protons and, in most cases, one or more neutrons. Outside of the nucleus we find one or more electrons in rapid motion (Figure 2.4).\nEach element has a unique atomic number equal to \nthe number of protons in the nucleus of its atom. Carbon (C), with 6 protons in its nucleus, has an atomic number of 6, whereas uranium (U), a much larger atom, has 92 protons in its nucleus and thus an atomic number of 92.\nBecause electrons have so little mass compared to pro-\ntons and neutrons, most of an atom\u2019s mass is concentrated in its \nnucleus. The mass of an atom is described by its mass num-ber, the total number of neutrons and protons in its nucleus. For example, a carbon atom with 6 protons and 6 neu-trons in its nucleus has a mass number of 12 (Figure 2.4).\nEach atom of a particular element has the same num-\nber of protons in its nucleus. But the nuclei of atoms of a particular element can vary in the number of neutrons they contain, and, therefore, in their mass numbers. The forms of an element having the same atomic number but different mass numbers are called isotopes of that ele-ment. Scientists identify isotopes by attaching their mass numbers to the name or symbol of the element. For ex-ample, the three most common isotopes of carbon are carbon-12 (with six protons and six neutrons, Figure 2.4), carbon-13 (with six protons and seven neutrons), and carbon-14 (with six protons and eight neutrons). Carbon-12 makes up about 98.9% of all naturally occur -\nring carbon.TABlE 2-1  chemical elements Used in \nThis Book\nElement Symbol Element Symbol\narsenic As lead Pb\nbromine Br lithium Li\ncalcium Ca mercury Hg\ncarbon C nitrogen N\ncopper Cu phosphorus P\nchlorine Cl sodium Na\nfluorine F sulfur S\ngold Au uranium U\n\u00a9 Cengage LearningFIGURE 2.4  A greatly simplified model of a carbon-12 atom.

Molecules are the basic building blocks of many compounds. For example, water is a compound with a molecule that consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen held together by chemical bonds. (For more examples, see Table 2.2 and Figure 4, p. S7, in Sup-plement 3.)\nA third building block of some types of matter is an \nion\u2014an atom or a group of atoms with one or more net positive or negative electrical charges as a result of losing or gaining one or more electrons. Chemists use a super -\nscript after the symbol of an ion to indicate the number of positive or negative electrical charges, as shown in Table 2.3. An important example of an ion is the nitrate ion, a nutrient essential for plant growth. In this chapter\u2019s (Core Case Study), Bormann and Likens measured the loss of nitrate ions from the deforested area (Figure 2.1, right) in their controlled experiment (Figure 2.5).\nIons are also important for measuring a substance\u2019s \nacidity in a water solution, which is based on the com-parative amounts of hydrogen ions (H\n+) and hydroxide \nions (OH\u2212) contained in a particular volume of the solu-\ntion. Scientists use pH as a measure of acidity. Pure water (not tap water or rainwater) has an equal number of H\n+ \nand OH\u2212 ions. It is called a neutral solution and has a pH of \n7. An acidic solution has more hydrogen ions than hydrox-ide ions and has a pH less than 7. A basic solution has more hydroxide ions than hydrogen ions and has a pH greater than 7.

S8, in Supplement 3.\nChemists use a chemical for -\nmula to show the number of each type of atom or ion in a compound.\n \nThis shorthand contains the symbol for each element present (Table 2.1) and uses subscripts to show the number of atoms or ions of each element in the compound\u2019s basic structural unit.

S9, in Supple-ment 3), and nucleic acids such as RNA and DNA, formed by monomers called nucleotides, and critical for reproduction (see Figures 9 and 10, p. S10, in Supplement 3). Lipids,  \nwhich include fats and waxes, are not made of monomers but are a fourth type of macromolecule essential for life (see Figure 11, p. S11, in Supplement 3).Matter Comes to Life through Cells, Genes, \nand Chromosomes\nAll organisms are composed of one or more cells\u2014the funda-\nmental structural and functional units of life. The idea that all living things are composed of cells is called the cell theory and it is the most widely accepted scientific theory in biology.\nWithin some DNA molecules (see Figure 10, p. S10, in \nSupplement 3) are certain sequences of nucleotides called genes. Each of these distinct pieces of DNA contains instruc-tions, or codes, called genetic information, for making specific proteins. Each of these coded units of genetic information leads to a specific trait, or characteristic, passed on from par -\nents to offspring during reproduction in an animal or plant.\nIn turn, thousands of genes make up a single chromo-\nsome, a double-helix DNA molecule wrapped around one or more proteins. Genetic information coded in your chromo-somal DNA is what makes you different from an oak leaf, an alligator, or a mosquito, and from your parents. The relation-ships of genetic material to cells are depicted in Figure 2.6.\nMatter Undergoes Physical, Chemical, and \nNuclear Changes\nWhen a sample of matter undergoes a physical change, \nthere is no change in its chemical composition. A piece of aluminum foil cut into small pieces is still aluminum foil. When solid water (ice) melts and when liquid water boils, the resulting liquid water and water vapor are still made up of H\n2O molecules.\nWhen a chemical change, or chemical reaction, takes \nplace, there is a change in the chemical composition of the substances involved. Chemists use a chemical equation to show how chemicals are rearranged in a chemical reaction. For example, coal is made up almost entirely of the element car -\nbon (C). When coal is burned completely in a power plant, the solid carbon in the coal combines with oxygen gas (O\n2) \nfrom the atmosphere to form the gaseous compound car -\nbon dioxide (CO 2). Chemists use the following shorthand \nchemical equation to represent this chemical reaction:\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\nEnergy+ +\nBlack solid Colorless gas Colorless gasC\nOC O OOReactant(s) Product(s)\nEnergy\nEnergyCarbon + Oxygen Carbon dioxide\nC+ + O2 CO2+\nIn addition to physical and chemical changes, matter can \nundergo three types of nuclear change, or change in the \nnuclei of its atoms. Radioactive decay occurs when the nuclei of unstable isotopes spontaneously emit fast-moving chunks of matter (alpha particles or beta particles), high-FIGURE 2.6  The relationships among cells, nuclei, chromosomes, \nDNA, and genes.\nPhoto: Flashon Studio/Shutterstock.com\nA human body contains trillions \nof cells, each with an identical set of", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3644, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "456b8d6a-a2f2-4801-919f-83be66892d46": {"__data__": {"id_": "456b8d6a-a2f2-4801-919f-83be66892d46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "G.

Each fission releases neutrons, which can cause more nuclei to fission. This cascade of fissions can result in a chain reaction that releases an enormous amount of energy in a short time. Nuclear fusion occurs when two nuclei of lighter atoms, such as hydrogen, are forced together at ex-tremely high temperatures until they fuse to form a heavier nucleus and release a tremendous amount of energy. (See Figure 14, p. S13, in Supplement 3 for diagrams showing radioactive decay, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion.)\nWe Cannot Create or Destroy Atoms: The \nLaw of Conservation of Matter\nWe can change elements and compounds from one physi-\ncal or chemical form to another, but we cannot create or destroy any of the atoms involved in any physical or chemi-cal change. All we can do is rearrange the atoms, ions, or molecules into different spatial patterns (physical changes) or chemical combinations (chemical changes). These facts, based on many thousands of measurements, describe a scientific law known as the law of conservation of mat-ter: Whenever matter undergoes a physical or chemical change, no atoms are created or destroyed (Concept 2.2B).\nChemical equations can be confusing in that they can \nseem to show atoms appearing or disappearing in chemical reactions. Chemists use a process of balancing the equation to account for all atoms involved in any reaction. See Supple-ment 3, p. S12, to learn how to balance chemical equations.\n2.3 WHAT IS ENERGY AND WHAT \nHAPPENS WHEN IT UNDERGOES CHANGE?\nCONCEPT 2.3A   Whenever energy is converted from one \nform to another in a physical or chemical change, no en-\nergy is created or destroyed (first law of thermodynamics).\nCONCEPT 2.3B   Whenever energy is converted from one \nform to another in a physical or chemical change, we end up with lower-quality or less-usable energy than we started with (second law of thermodynamics).\nEnergy Comes in Many Forms\nSuppose you find this book on the floor and you pick it up \nand put it on your desktop. To do this you have to use a certain amount of muscular force, or work, to move the book from one place to another. In scientific terms, work is done when any object is moved a certain distance (work = force \u00d7 distance). Energy is the capacity to do work.There are two major types of energy: moving energy \n(called kinetic energy) and stored energy (called potential energy). Matter in motion has kinetic energy, or energy associated with motion. Examples are flowing water, a car speeding down the highway, electricity (electrons flowing through a wire or other conducting material), and wind (a mass of moving air that we can use to produce electricity, as shown in Figure 2.7).\nFIGURE 2.7  Kinetic energy, created by the gaseous molecules in a \nmass of moving air, turns the blades of these wind turbines. The tur -\nbines then convert this kinetic energy to electrical energy, which is \nanother form of kinetic energy.Yegor Korzh/Shutterstock.comWind and electricity are two \nforms of kinetic energy.\n90446_ch02_024-039.indd   33 8/13/14   8:18 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

If the atoms, ions, or mole-cules in a sample of matter move faster, the matter will become warmer. When two objects at different tempera-tures come in contact with one another, heat flows from the warmer object to the cooler object. You learned this the first time you touched a hot stove.\nIn another form of kinetic energy called electromag-\nnetic radiation, energy travels in the form of a wave as a result of changes in electrical and magnetic fields. There are many different forms of electromagnetic radiation (Figure 2.8), each having a different wavelength (the dis-tance between successive peaks or troughs in the wave), and energy content. Those with short wavelengths have \nmore energy than do those with longer wavelengths.\nThe other major type of energy is potential energy, \nwhich is stored and potentially available for use. Examples of this type of energy include a rock held in your hand, the water in a reservoir behind a dam, and the chemical en-ergy stored in the carbon atoms of coal or in the molecules of any food that you eat.\nWe can change potential energy to kinetic energy. If \nyou hold this book in your hand, it has potential energy. However, if you drop it on your foot, the book\u2019s potential energy changes to kinetic energy. When a car engine burns gasoline, the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of the gasoline molecules changes into kinetic en-ergy that propels the car, and into heat that flows into the environment. When water in a reservoir flows through channels in a dam (Figure 2.9), its potential energy be-comes kinetic energy used to spin turbines in the dam to produce electricity\u2014another form of kinetic energy.\nAbout 99% of the energy that keeps us warm and sup-\nports the plants that we and other organisms eat comes from the sun at no cost to us, in keeping with the solar energy principle of sustainability (see Figure 1.2, \np. 6 and Supplement 7, p. S50). Without this es-sentially inexhaustible solar energy, the earth would be frozen and life as we know it would not exist.\nCommercial energy\u2014energy that is sold in the market-\nplace\u2014makes up the remaining 1% of the energy we use to supplement the earth\u2019s direct input of solar energy. About 87% of the commercial energy used in the world and 87% of that used in the United States comes from the burning of nonrenewable fossil fuels\u2014oil, coal, and natural gas. They are called fossil fuels because they were formed over hundreds of thousands to millions of years as layers of the decaying remains of ancient plants and animals were exposed to intense heat and pressure within the earth\u2019s crust.\nSome Types of Energy Are More Useful \nThan Others\nEnergy quality is a measure of the capacity of a type of \nenergy to do useful work. High-quality energy is con-centrated energy that has a high capacity to do useful work. Examples are very high-temperature heat, concen-trated sunlight, high-speed wind, and the energy released when we burn wood, gasoline, natural gas, or coal.\nBy contrast, low-quality energy is energy that is so \ndispersed that it has little capacity to do useful work. For example, the enormous number of moving molecules in the atmosphere or in an ocean together have such low-quality energy, and such a low temperature, that we can-not use them to move things or to heat things to high temperatures.\nEnergy Changes Are Governed by Two \nScientific Laws\nAfter observing and measuring energy being changed from \none form to another in millions of physical and chemical changes, scientists have summarized their results in the first law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of ANIMATED FIGURE 2.8  The electromagnetic", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3903, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0edea5fb-9e54-4460-857f-1a7f5fd69b8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0edea5fb-9e54-4460-857f-1a7f5fd69b8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "G.

This is one of nature\u2019s basic rules that we cannot violate.\nBecause the first law of thermodynamics states that \nenergy cannot be created or destroyed, but only converted from one form to another, you may be tempted to think we will never have to worry about running out of energy.

The answer is energy quality, the amount of energy available for performing useful work.\nThousands of experiments have shown that whenever \nenergy is converted from one form to another in a physical or chemical change, we end up with lower-quality or less usable energy than we started with (Concept 2.3B). This is a statement of the second law of thermodynamics. The resulting low-quality energy usually takes the form of heat that flows into the environment. In the environment, the random motion of air or water molecules further disperses this heat, decreasing its temperature to the point where its energy quality is too low to do much useful work.\nSongquan Deng/Shutterstock\nFIGURE 2.9  The water stored in this reservoir behind a dam has potential energy, which becomes ki-\nnetic energy when the water flows through channels built into the dam where it spins a turbine and \nproduces electricity\u2014another form of kinetic energy.Water behind a dam has potential energy \nthat becomes kinetic energy when the water flows out of the reservoir.\n90446_ch02_024-039.indd   35 8/13/14   8:18 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This means that we cannot recycle or reuse high-quality energy to perform useful work. Once the concentrated, high-quality energy in a serving of food, a tank of gasoline, or a chunk of uranium nuclear fuel is released, it is degraded to low-quality heat and dispersed into the environment.\n2.4 WHAT ARE SYSTEMS AND  \nHOW DO THEY RESPOND  TO CHANGE?\nCONCEPT 2.4   Systems have inputs, flows, and outputs of \nmatter and energy, and feedback can affect their behavior.\nThere Are Nonliving and  \nLiving Systems\nA system is a set of components that func-\ntion and interact in some regular way. A \ncell, the human body, a forest, a river, an economy, and the earth are all systems. Nonliving systems such as a car or a TV do not change their size or how they perform in response to changes in environmental conditions. In contrast, living systems can change their size and components and how they behave in response to changing environmental conditions. For example, our bodies produce a new layer of skin cells about every 28 days.\nMost living systems have the following \nkey components: inputs of matter and energy from the environment, flows or throughputs of matter and energy within the system, and outputs of matter and energy to the environment (Figure 2.10) (Concept 2.4). A living system can become unsustainable if the throughputs of matter and energy resources exceed the abilities of the system\u2019s environment to provide the required resource inputs and to absorb or dilute the system\u2019s outputs of matter and energy.\nSystems Respond to Change \nthrough Feedback Loops\nMost systems are affected in one way or another by \n feedback, any process that increases (positive feedback) \nor decreases (negative feedback) a change to a system  (Concept 2.4). Such a process, called a feedback loop, occurs when an output of matter, energy, or information is fed back into the system as an input and leads to changes in that system. A positive feedback loop causes a system to change further in the same direction (Figure 2.11).\nFor example, in the Hubbard Brook experiments (Core \nCase Study), researchers found that when vegetation was removed from a stream valley, flowing water from precipi-\nFIGURE 2.10  A greatly simplified model of a system.ThroughputsInputs\n(from environment)Outputs\n(to environment)\nWork or\nproducts\nWaste and\npollutionSystem\nprocesses\nHeatEnergy\nresources\nMatter\nresources\nInformation\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\nFIGURE 2.11  A positive feedback loop.

With even less vegetation to hold soil in place, flowing water caused even more erosion and nutrient loss, which caused even more plants to die.\nWhen a natural system gets locked into such a positive \nfeedback loop, it can reach an ecological tipping point beyond which the system can be drastically changed, ex-periencing severe degradation or collapse. There are many types of ecological tipping points that we discuss through-out this book.\nA negative, or corrective, feedback loop causes a \nsystem to change in the opposite direction from which it is moving. An example of a negative feedback loop is the recycling of aluminum. An aluminum can is an output of mining and manufacturing systems that require large in-puts of energy and matter and that produce pollution and solid waste. When we recycle the can, that output be-comes an input that lessens the need for the mining and manufacturing processes, as well as their energy and mat-ter inputs and harmful environmental effects. Such a negative feedback loop is an application of the chemical cycling principle of sustainability.\nIn the controlled  experiment discussed in \nthis chapter\u2019s Core Case Study, the clearing of a mature for -\nest degraded some of its natural capital (see Figure 1.3,  \np. 7, and photo at right). Specifically, the loss of trees and \nvegetation altered the ability of the forest to retain and \n recycle water and other critical plant nutrients\u2014a crucial ecological function based on one of the three  \nscientific principles of sustainability.\nThis clearing of vegetation also violated the other two \nscientific principles of sustainability. For example, the cleared forest lost most of its plants that had used solar energy to produce food for the forest\u2019s animals, which sup-plied nutrients to the soil when they died. Thus the forest lost many of its key nutrients that would normally have been recycled, and it lost much of its life-sustaining biodiversity.\nMany of the results of environmental science are based \non this sort of experimentation. Throughout this textbook, we explore other examples of scientists\u2019 work, as well as ways to use their results to understand how our actions af-fect the environment and how we can try to solve some of our environmental problems.Tying i T ALL Toge Ther\nThe Hubbard Brook Forest Experiment and Sustainability\n\u2022 According to the law of conservation of matter, \nno atoms are created or destroyed whenever \nmatter undergoes a physical or chemical change. Thus, we cannot do away with matter; we can only change it from one physical state or chemical form to another.\n\u2022\n According to the first law of thermodynamics, \nor the law of conservation of energy, whenever \nenergy is converted from one form to another in a physical or chemical change, no energy is created or destroyed. This means that in causing such changes, we cannot get more energy out than we put in.\n\u2022\n According to the second law of \nthermodynamics, whenever energy is converted \nfrom one form to another in a physical or chemical change, we always end up with lower-quality or less-usable energy than we started with.Big idEaS\nsteve estvanik/Shutterstock.com\n Concept 2.4  \u00a0  37\n90446_ch02_024-039.indd   37 8/13/14   2:26 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

These lush forests are warm year round and have high humidity and heavy rain-fall almost daily. Although they cover only about 2% of the earth\u2019s land sur -\nface, studies indicate that they contain up to half of the world\u2019s known terres-trial plant and animal species. For these reasons, they make an excellent natural lab\n oratory for the study of \necosystems\u2014communities of organ-isms interacting with one another and with the physical environment of mat-ter and energy in which they live (see chapter-opening photo).\nSo far, at least half of these forests \nhave been destroyed or disturbed by humans cutting down trees, growing crops, grazing cattle, and building \n settlements (Figure 3.1), and the  degradation of these centers of bio -\ndiversity is increasing. Ecologists warn that without strong protective mea-sures, most of these forests will prob\n-\nably be gone or severely degraded by the end of this century.\nSo why should we care that trop\n-\nical rain forests are disappearing? \n Scientists give three reasons. First,  \nclearing these forests will reduce the earth\u2019s vital biodiversity by destroying or degrading the habitats of many of the unique plant and animal species that live in them, which could lead to the early extinction of these species and other species that depend on them.\nSecond, the destruction of these \nforests is helping to accelerate atmo-spheric warming, and thus projected climate change (as discussed in more detail in Chapter 15). The reason is that eliminating large areas of trees faster \nthan they can grow back decreases the for -\nests\u2019 ability to remove from the atmosphere the human-generated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO\n2), a gas that contributes \nto atmospheric warming and pro-jected climate change.\nThird, large-scale rain forest losses \ncan change regional weather patterns in ways that can prevent the return of diverse tropical rain forests in cleared or severely degraded areas. When this irreversible ecological tipping point is \nreached, tropical rain forests in such areas become much less diverse tropi-cal grasslands.\nAgronomist and National Geo-\ngraphic Explorer Vitor O. Becker has studied tropical forests in Latin Amer -\nica for decades. Like many ecologists, he studies ecosystems to learn how their varieties of organisms interact with their living (biotic) environment of other organisms and with their nonliving (abiotic) environment of soil, \nwater, other forms of matter, and energy, mostly from the sun. In effect, ecologists study connections in nature.  \nIn this chapter, we look more closely at how tropical rain forests and other ecosystems work, how human activi-ties are affecting them, and how we can try to preserve them.Tropical Rain Forests Are Disappearing\n42 \nFIGURE 3.1   Natural capital degradation: Satellite image of the \nloss of topical rain forest, cleared for farming, cattle grazing, \nand settlements, near the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz between June 1975 (left) and May 2003 (right).\nLeft: United Nations Environment Programme; Right: United Nations Environment Programme\n90446_ch03_040-061.indd   42 8/13/14   8:23 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Its inner layer, the tropo-\nsphere, extends about 17 kilometers (11 miles) above sea level at the tropics and about 7 kilometers (4 miles) above the earth\u2019s north and south poles. It contains the air we breathe, consisting mostly of nitrogen (78% of the total volume) and oxygen (21%). Most of the remaining 1% of the air consists of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and meth-ane. The next layer, reaching from 17 to 50 kilometers (11\u201331 miles) above the earth\u2019s surface, is called the stratosphere. Its lower portion holds enough ozone (O\n3) \ngas to filter out about 95% of the sun\u2019s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This global sunscreen allows life to exist on the surface of the planet.\nThe hydrosphere is made up of all of the water on or \nnear the earth\u2019s surface. It is found as water vapor in the atmosphere, as liquid water on the surface and under -\nground, and as ice\u2014polar ice, icebergs, glaciers, and ice in frozen soil-layers called permafrost. The oceans, which cover about 71% of the globe, contain about 97% of the earth\u2019s water and support about half of the world\u2019s species.\nThe geosphere consists of the earth\u2019s intensely hot \ncore, a thick mantle composed mostly of rock, and a thin outer crust. The crust\u2019s upper portion contains soil chemi-\ncals that organisms need in order to live, grow, and repro-duce (nutrients), as well as nonrenewable fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014and minerals that we use.\nThe biosphere consists of the parts of the atmosphere, \nhydrosphere, and geosphere where life is found. If the earth were an apple, the biosphere would be no thicker than the apple\u2019s skin. An important goal of environmental science is to understand the key interactions that occur within this thin layer of air, water, soil, and organisms and how we interact with the biosphere.\nThree Factors Sustain the Earth\u2019s Life\nLife on the earth depends on three interconnected factors (Concept 3.1B):\n1.\n The one-way flow of high-quality energy from the sun, \nthrough living things in their feeding interactions, into \nthe environment as low-quality energy (mostly heat dispersed into air or water at a low temperature), and eventually to outer space as heat (Figure 3.3). This  \nis the basis for the solar energy principle of sustainability. As solar energy interacts with carbon dioxide (CO\n2), water vapor, and several other \ngases in the troposphere, it warms the troposphere\u2014  \na process known as the greenhouse effect. Without this natural process, the earth would be too cold to support most of the forms of life we find here today.\n2.\n The cycling of nutrients (the atoms, ions, and molecules \nof elements and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3467, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8650cb1-0196-41f7-a1e3-9a9b647be933": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8650cb1-0196-41f7-a1e3-9a9b647be933", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "G.

Gravity, which allows the planet to hold onto its \natmosphere and helps to enable the movement and cycling of chemicals through air, water, soil, and organisms.\n3.2 WHAT ARE THE MAJOR \nCOMPONENTS OF AN ECOSYSTEM?\nCONCEPT 3.2   Some organisms produce the nutrients they \nneed, others get the nutrients they need by consuming \nother organisms, and some recycle nutrients back to pro-ducers by decomposing the wastes and remains of other organisms.\nEcosystems Have Several  \nImportant Components\nEcology is the science that focuses on how organisms in-\nteract with one another and with their nonliving environ-ment of matter and energy. Scientists classify matter into levels of organization ranging from atoms to galaxies. Ecologists study interactions within and among five of these levels\u2014organisms, populations, communities, \necosystems, and the biosphere, which are illustrated and defined in Figure 3.4.The biosphere and its ecosystems are made up of living \n(biotic) and nonliving (abiotic) components (Figure 3.5). Examples of nonliving components are water, air, nutri-ents, rocks, heat, and solar energy. Living components in-clude plants, animals, microbes, and all other organisms.\nEcologists assign each organism in an ecosystem to a \nfeeding level, or trophic level, depending on its source of nutrients. We can broadly classify living organisms as pro-ducers and consumers.\nProducers, sometimes called autotrophs (self-feeders), \nmake the nutrients they need from compounds and en-ergy obtained from their environment (Concept 3.2). In a process called photosynthesis, plants capture solar en-ergy that falls on their leaves and use it in combination with carbon dioxide and water to form organic molecules, including energy-rich carbohydrates (such as glucose, C\n6H12O6), which store the chemical energy that plants \nneed. We can summarize the overall chemical reaction for photosynthesis as follows:\ncarbon dioxide + water +  solar energy \u2192 glucose + oxygen\n6 CO 2 + 6 H 2O + solar energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6 O 2\n(See Supplement 3, p. S12, for information on how to bal-ance chemical equations such as this one.)\nAbout 2.8 billion years ago, producer organisms called \ncyanobacteria, most of them floating on the surface of the ocean, began to carry out the process of photosynthesis. At that time the atmosphere contained essentially no oxygen. \n1. The solar energy that \npowers the earth\u2019s climate system is short-wave radiation.\n3. Some of the incoming solar radiation is re/f_lected by the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere back out to space.2. Roughly half of the incoming solar radiation is absorbed by the earth\u2019s surface.4. The solar radiation absorbed by the earth\u2019s surface is converted to heat and emitted as long-wave radiation.\n5. Some of the infrared radiation escapes into space, but most of it is absorbed by greenhouse gases and clouds in the earth\u2019s atmosphere, and this interaction between gases and radiation warms the earth\u2019s lower atmosphere and surface.\nANIMATED FIGURE 3.3   Greenhouse Earth. high-quality solar energy flows from the sun to the \nearth. It is degraded to lower quality energy (mostly heat) as it interacts with the earth\u2019s air, water, soil, \nand life forms, and eventually returns to space. Certain gases in the earth\u2019s atmosphere retain enough \nof the sun\u2019s incoming energy as heat to warm the planet in what is known as the greenhouse effect.\nNational Geographic\n90446_ch03_040-061.indd   44 8/13/14   8:23 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In freshwater and ocean ecosystems, algae and aquatic plants growing near shorelines are the major producers. In open water, the dominant producers are phytoplankton\u2014mostly microscopic organisms that float or drift in the water.\nThe other organisms in an ecosystem are consumers, \nor heterotrophs (\u201cother-feeders\u201d), which cannot pro-\nduce the nutrients they need through photosynthesis or other processes (Concept 3.2). They get their nutrients by feeding on other organisms (producers or other consum-ers) or their wastes and remains.\nThere are several types of consumers. Primary con-\nsumers, or herbivores (plant eaters), are animals that eat mostly green plants. Examples are caterpillars, giraffes, and zooplankton (tiny sea animals that feed on phyto-plankton). Carnivores (meat eaters) are animals that feed \non the flesh of other animals. Some carnivores such as spiders, lions (Figure 3.6), and most small fishes are sec-ondary consumers that feed on the flesh of herbivores. Other carnivores such as tigers, hawks, and killer whales (orcas) are tertiary (or higher-level) consumers that feed on the flesh of herbivores and other carnivores. Some of these relationships are shown in Figure 3.5. Omni-vores such as pigs, rats, and humans eat both plants and animals.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT What You Eat\nWhen you ate your most recent meal, were you an herbivore, a carnivore, or an \nomnivore?\nDecomposers are consumers that, in the process of \nobtaining their nutrients, release nutrients from the wastes \nor remains of plants and animals and return those nutri-ents to the soil, water, and air for reuse by producers (Concept 3.2). Most decomposers are bacteria and fungi (Science Focus 3.1). Other consumers, called detritus feeders, or detritivores, feed on the wastes or dead bod-ies (detritus) of other organisms. Examples are earth-worms, hyenas, and vultures.\nHordes of detritivores and decomposers can transform a \nfallen tree trunk into wood particles and, finally, into simple inorganic molecules that plants can absorb as nutrients \nBiosphere\nEcosystem\nCommunity\nPopulation\nOrganismParts of the earth's air,\nwater, and soil where lifeis found\nA community of di\ufb00erent\nspecies interacting with oneanother and with theirnonliving environment ofmatter and energy\nPopulations of di\ufb00erent\nspecies living in a particularplace, and potentiallyinteracting with each other\nA group of individuals of the\nsame species living in aparticular place\nAn individual living being\nCellThe fundamental structural\nand functional unit of life\nMoleculeChemical combination of twoor more atoms of the same ordi\ufb00erent elements\nAtomSmallest unit of a chemicalelement that exhibits itschemical properties\nWater\nOxygen HydrogenO\nH H\nH O\nANIMATED FIGURE 3.4   Some of the levels of the organization of \nmatter in nature.

A sequence of organ-isms, each of which serves as a source of nutrients or en-ergy for the next, is called a food chain as shown in Figure 3.9. Every use and transfer of energy by organisms involves a loss of some high-quality energy to the environ-ment as low-quality energy in the form of heat, in accor -\ndance with the second law of thermodynamics.\nIn natural ecosystems, most consumers feed on more \nthan one type of organism, and most organisms are eaten or decomposed by more than one type of consumer. Be-cause of this, organisms in most ecosystems form a com-plex network of interconnected food chains called a food web (Figure 3.10). Food chains and food webs show how producers, consumers, and decomposers are connected to one another as energy flows through trophic levels in an ecosystem. The pyramid of energy flow in Figure 3.11 illustrates this energy loss for a simple food chain, assum-ing a 90% energy loss with each transfer.\nFirst Tr ophic \nLevelSecond Tr ophic\nLevelThird Tr ophic \nLevelFourth Tr ophic \nLevel\nDecomposers and detritus feedersProducers\n(plants)Primary\nconsumers\n(herbivores)Secondary\nconsumers\n(carnivores)Tertiary\nconsumers\n(top carnivores)\nHeatHeat\nHeatHeat Heat Heat Heat\nSolar\nenergy\nANIMATED FIGURE 3.9   In a food chain, chemical energy in nutrients flows through various trophic \nlevels. Question: Think about what you ate for breakfast.

To stay alive, grow, and reproduce, produc-ers must use some of their stored chemical energy for their own respiration. Net primary productivity (NPP) is the rate at which producers use photosynthesis to produce and store chemical energy minus the rate at which they use some of this stored chemical energy through aerobic respi-ration. NPP measures how fast producers can make the chemical energy that is stored in their tissues and that is potentially available to other organisms (consumers) in an ecosystem.\nTerrestrial ecosystems and aquatic life zones differ in \ntheir NPP as illustrated in Figure 3.12. Despite its low NPP, the open ocean produces more of the earth\u2019s biomass per year than any other ecosystem or life zone. This occurs because of the enormous volume of the global ocean, which covers 71% of the earth\u2019s surface and contains huge numbers of phytoplankton and other producers.\nTropical rain forests have a very high net primary pro-\nductivity because they have a large number and variety of producer trees and other plants. When such forests are cleared (Core Case Study) or burned to make way for crops or for grazing cattle, they suffer a sharp drop in net pri-mary productivity and a loss of many of their diverse array of plant and animal species.\nOnly the plant matter represented by NPP is available \nas nutrients for consumers, and they use only a portion of it.

This is in keeping with the chemical cycling principle of sustainabil-ity. These cycles, which are driven directly or indi-rectly by incoming solar energy and by the earth\u2019s gravity, include the hydrologic (water), carbon, nitrogen, phos-phorus, and sulfur cycles.CONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Nutrient Cycles and Life\nnutrient cycles connect past, present, and future forms of life. Some of the car -\nbon atoms in your skin may once have been part of an oak leaf, a dinosaur\u2019s \nskin, or a layer of limestone rock. Your grandmother, George Washington, or a hunter\u2013gatherer who lived 25,000 years ago may have inhaled some of the nitrogen molecules you just inhaled.\nThe Water Cycle\nWater (H 2O) is an amazing substance (Science Focus 3.2) \nthat is necessary for life on the earth. The hydrologic \ncycle, or water cycle, collects, purifies, and distributes the earth\u2019s fixed supply of water, as shown in Figure 3.13.\nThe sun powers the water cycle. Incoming solar energy \ncauses evaporation, or the conversion of water from liquid to \nvapor from the earth\u2019s oceans, lakes, rivers, soil, and plants. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere, where it con-denses into droplets, and gravity then draws the water back to the earth\u2019s surface as precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, and dew). Over land, about 90% of the water that reaches the atmosphere evaporates from the surfaces of plants through a process called transpiration and from the soil.\nMost precipitation falling on terrestrial ecosystems \n becomes surface runoff.

Some precipitation seeps into the upper layers of soils where it is used by plants, and some evaporates from the soils back into the atmosphere. Some precipitation also sinks through soil into under -\nground layers of rock, sand, and gravel called aquifers, where it is stored as groundwater. Some precipitation is \nconverted to ice that is stored in glaciers, usually for long periods of time.\nBecause water is good at dissolving many different \ncompounds, it can easily be polluted. Throughout the hy-drologic cycle, many natural processes purify water by drawing pollutants out of it. Thus, the hydrologic cycle can be viewed as a cycle of natural renewal of water quality\u2014an im-portant and free ecosystem service.\nOnly about 0.024% of the earth\u2019s vast water supply is \navailable to humans and other species as liquid freshwater in accessible groundwater deposits and in lakes, rivers, and streams. The rest is too salty for us to use, is stored as ice, or is too deep underground to extract at affordable prices.\nHumans alter the water cycle in three major ways (see \nthe red arrows and boxes in Figure 3.13). First, we with-draw freshwater from rivers, lakes, and aquifers, some-times at rates faster than natural processes can replace it. As a result, some aquifers are being depleted and some rivers no longer flow to the ocean. Second, we clear vege-tation from land for agriculture, mining, road building, and other activities, and cover much of the land with buildings, concrete, and asphalt. This increases runoff and reduces infiltration that would normally recharge ground-water supplies. Third, we drain and fill wetlands for farm-ing and urban development. Left undisturbed, wetlands provide the ecosystem service of flood control, acting like sponges to absorb and hold overflows of water from drenching rains or rapidly melting snow.\nWater ( h2O) is a remarkable sub-\nstance with a unique combination of \nproperties:\n\u2022\tForces of attraction, called hydro\u00ad\ngen bonds (see Figure 6, p. S8, in Supplement 3), hold water molecules together and are the major fac-tor determining water\u2019s distinctive \n properties.\n\u2022\tWater exists as a liquid over a wide temperature range because of the \n hydrogen bonds between its mol\u00adecules. If liquid water had a much narrower range of temperatures between freezing and boiling, the oceans might have frozen solid or boiled away long ago.\n\u2022\tLiquid water changes temperature slowly because it can store a large amount of heat without a large change in its own temperature. This high heat storage capacity helps to protect living organisms from temperature changes, moderates the earth\u2019s climate, and makes water an excellent coolant for car engines and power plants.\n\u2022\n\t\tIt takes a large amount of energy to evaporate water because of its hydrogen bonds. Water absorbs large amounts of heat as it changes into water vapor and releases this heat as the vapor condenses back to liquid water. This helps to distribute heat throughout the world and to deter-mine regional and local climates.

Typically, CO 2 remains in the atmo-\nsphere for 100 years or more. In water, decomposers release carbon that can be stored as insoluble carbonates in bottom sediment for very long periods of time. Every living thing on the earth is part of the natural carbon cycle.\nOver millions of years, the carbon in deeply buried \ndeposits of dead plant matter and algae were converted by high pressure from the weight of overlying sediments and heat released during the decomposition of dead matter into carbon-containing fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas (Figure 3.14). In only a few hundred years, we have extracted and burned huge quantities of fossil fuels that took millions of years to form and added large quanti-ties of CO\n2 to the atmosphere, thus altering the carbon \ncycle (see the red arrows in Figure 3.14).

The Nitrogen Cycle: Bacteria in Action\nNitrogen gas (N 2) makes up 78% of the volume of the at-\nmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be absorbed and used directly \nas a nutrient by plants or animals, but as a component of compounds such as ammonia (NH\n3) and ammonium ions \n(NH 4+), it becomes a plant nutrient.\nThese compounds are created within the nitrogen \ncycle (Figure 3.15) by reactions involving lightning and by specialized bacteria found in the top layer of soil. Other specialized bacteria convert most of the NH\n3 and NH 4+ in \nthe soil to nitrate ions (NO 3\u2212), which are easily taken up by \nthe roots of plants. The plants then use these forms of ni-trogen to produce various proteins, nucleic acids, and vita-mins. Animals that eat plants eventually consume these nitrogen-containing compounds, as do detritus feeders and decomposers. Different specialized bacteria in water -\nlogged soil and in the bottom sediments of lakes, oceans, swamps, and bogs convert these various nitrogen com-pounds back into nitrogen gas (N\n2), which is released to \nthe atmosphere to begin the nitrogen cycle again.We intervene in the nitrogen cycle in several ways (see \nthe red arrows in Figure 3.15). We add large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) as a product of combustion when we burn gasoline and other fuels. In the atmosphere, NO can be converted to nitrogen dioxide gas (NO\n2) and nitric acid \nvapor (HNO 3), which can return to the earth\u2019s surface as \ndamaging acid deposition, commonly called acid rain.\nWe also remove large amounts of nitrogen (N 2) from \nthe atmosphere to make ammonia (NH 3) and ammonium \nions (NH 4+), which are used to make fertilizers. In addi-\ntion, we alter the nitrogen cycle in aquatic ecosystems by adding excess nitrates (NO\n3\u2212) to bodies of water through \nagricultural runoff of fertilizers and animal manure and through discharges from municipal sewage treatment sys-tems. This can cause excessive growth of algae that can disrupt aquatic systems.\nAccording to the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assess-\nment, since 1950, human activities have more than dou-bled the annual release of nitrogen from the land into the rest of the environment, mostly from the greatly increased use of inorganic fertilizers to grow crops.

Most of these compounds contain phosphate ions (PO\n43\u2212), which serve as an impor -\ntant plant nutrient. Phosphorus does not cycle through the atmosphere and its cycle is slow compared to the cycling of water, carbon, and nitrogen.\nAs water runs over exposed rocks, it slowly erodes \naway inorganic compounds that contain phosphate ions and carries these ions into the soil where they can be ab-sorbed by the roots of plants and by other producers. Phos-phate compounds are then transferred by food webs from producers to consumers and eventually to detritus feeders and decomposers.Phosphate can be lost from the cycle for long periods \nof time when it is washed into the ocean where it is typi-cally deposited as marine sediment and can remain trapped for millions of years. Over time, geological processes can uplift and expose these seafloor deposits, from which phosphate can be eroded and freed up to reenter the phos-phorus cycle.\nBecause most soils contain little phosphate, the lack of \nit often limits plant growth on land unless phosphorus (as phosphate salts mined from the earth) is applied to the soil as a fertilizer. Lack of phosphorus also limits the growth of producer populations in many freshwater streams and lakes because phosphate salts are only slightly soluble in water and thus do not release many phosphate ions to producers in aquatic systems.\nHuman activities, including the removal of large \namounts of phosphate from the earth to make fertilizer, are affecting the phosphorus cycle (see red arrows in Fig-ure 3.16).

There they stimulate the growth of producers such as algae and various aquatic plants, which can upset chemical cycling and other processes in bodies of water.\nThe Sulfur Cycle\nSulfur circulates through the biosphere in the sulfur \n cycle, shown in Figure 3.17. Much of the earth\u2019s sulfur  \nis stored underground in rocks and minerals and in the form of sulfate (SO\n42\u2212) salts buried deep under ocean \nsediments.\nSulfur also enters the atmosphere from several natural \nsources. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2S)\u2014a colorless, highly poi-\nsonous gas with a rotten-egg smell\u2014is released from active volcanoes and from organic matter broken down by an-aerobic decomposers in flooded swamps, bogs, and tidal flats. Sulfur dioxide (SO\n2), a colorless and suffocating gas, \nalso comes from volcanoes.Particles of sulfate (SO 42\u2212) salts, such as ammonium \nsulfate, enter the atmosphere from sea spray, dust storms, and forest fires. Plant roots absorb sulfate ions and incor -\nporate the sulfur as an essential component of many proteins.\nIn the oxygen-deficient environments of flooded soils, \nfreshwater wetlands, and tidal flats, specialized bacteria convert sulfate ions to sulfide ions (S\n2\u2212). The sulfide ions \ncan then react with metal ions to form insoluble metallic sulfides, which are deposited as rock or metal ores (often extracted by mining and converted to various metals), and the cycle continues.\nHuman activities have affected the sulfur cycle primar -\nily by releasing large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO\n2) into \nthe atmosphere (as shown by the red arrows in Figure 3.17). We release sulfur to the atmosphere in three ways. First, we burn sulfur-containing coal and oil to produce electric power. Second, we refine sulfur-containing oil (pe-troleum) to make gasoline, heating oil, and other useful products.

Field research, sometimes called \u201cmuddy-\nboots biology,\u201d involves going into forests and other natu-ral settings to study the structure of ecosystems and what happens in them (see Chapter 2 opening photo). Most of what we know about ecosystems has come from such re-search (Individuals Matter 3.1). \nGREEN CAREER:  Ecologist\nScientists use a variety of methods to study tropical \nforests (Core Case Study). In a few cases, ecologists have erected tall construction cranes that provide them access to the canopies of tropical forests. This, along with climb-ing trees (see Chapter 2 opening photo) and erecting rope walkways between treetops, has helped them to identify and observe the rich diversity of species living or feeding in these treetop habitats.\nConservationist, pilot, and National Geographic Ex-\nplorer Michael Fay has flown over vast areas of African forests. The government of Gabon used the 116,000 pho-tographs that he took to create a system of 13 protected national parks. Recently he spent a year hiking through what remains of California\u2019s redwood forests and collect-ing ecological data to help understand and protect this one-of-a-kind ecosystem.\nSometimes ecologists carry out controlled experiments \nby isolating and changing a variable in part of an area and comparing the results with nearby unchanged areas. We learned about a classic example of this in the Core Case Study of Chapter 2 (p. 26).\nScientists also use aircraft and satellites equipped with \nsophisticated cameras and other remote sensing devices to scan and collect data on the earth\u2019s surface (see Figure 2, p. S16, in Supplement 4). Then they use geographic infor -\nmation system (GIS) software to capture, store, analyze, and display such information. For example, a GIS can convert digital satellite images into global, regional, and local maps showing variations in vegetation, gross primary productiv-ity, air pollution emissions, and many other variables.\nSome researchers attach tiny radio transmitters to ani-\nmals and use global positioning systems (GPS) to learn about the animals by tracking where and how far they go. This technology is very important for studying endangered species (which we discuss in Chapter 8). \nGREEN CAREERS:  \nGIS analyst; remote sensing analyst\nindividuals matter 3.1 \nThomas E.

This general stability has allowed the human population to grow, develop agriculture, and take over a large and growing share of the earth\u2019s land and other resources.\nAccording to a number of scientists, \nsince the industrial revolution began around 1750, we have entered an era called the Anthropocene. In this new era, humans have become major agents of change in the functioning of the earth\u2019s life-support system as their ecological footprints have spread over the earth (see Figure 1-11, p. 14).\nIn 2009, an international group of \n28 scientists, led by Johan \nrockstr\u00f6m \nof the Stockholm resilience Centre, es-\ntimated nine major planetary bounda\u00adries or ecological tipping points, three of which they say we have already exceeded (Figure 3.A). According to these scientists, if we exceed too many of these boundaries, we could trigger abrupt and long-lasting or irreversible environmental changes that could seri-ously degrade the earth\u2019s life-support system.\nSome scientists argue that there is \nan urgent need for more research to fill in the missing data on these TESTING PLANETARY BOUNDARIES: FROM HOLOCENE TO ANTHROPOCENE\nplanetary boundaries and on how our exceeding them could affect the health of humans, other species, and the earth\u2019s life-support systems.

Find three things that you do regularly that contribute to these impacts.\nData Analysis\nRecall that net primary productivity (NPP) is the rate at which producers can make the chemical energy that is stored in their tissues and that is potentially available to other organisms (consumers) in an ecosystem. In Figure 3.15, it is expressed as units of energy (kilocalories, or kcal) produced in a given area (square meters, or m\n2) over \na period of time (a year). Look again at Figure 3.12 and consider the differences in NPP among various ecosys-tems. Then answer the following questions:\n 1. What is the approximate NPP of a tropical rain forest in kcal/m\n2/yr? Which terrestrial ecosystem produces about one-third of that rate? Which aquatic ecosys-tem has about the same NPP as a tropical rain forest?\n 2. Early in the 20th century, large areas of temperate forestland in the United States were cleared to make way for agricultural land. For each unit of this forest area that was cleared and replaced by farmland, about how much NPP was lost?\n 3. Why do you think deserts and grasslands have dra-matically lower NPP than swamps and marshes?\n 4. About how many times more NPP do estuaries pro-duce, compared to lakes and streams?

They have adjusted to and survived environmen-tal changes more effectively than many other species. However, the amphibian world is changing rapidly.\nAn amphibian lives part of its life \nin water and part on land. Now, many of the 6,700 or more amphibian spe-cies are having difficulty adapting to rapid changes that have taken place in their water and land habitats during the past few decades. Such changes have resulted primarily from human activities such as use of pesticides and other chemicals that can become water pollutants.\nSince 1980, populations of hun-\ndreds of amphibian species through-out the world have declined or vanished (Figure 4.1). According to  \nthe International Union for Conserva-tion of Nature (IUCN), about 41%  \nof all known amphibian species are threatened with extinction, the pro-cess in which they could cease to exist (see chapter-opening photo).\nNo single cause has been found to \nexplain the declines of many amphib-ian species. However, scientists have identified a number of factors that affect amphibians at various points  \nin their life cycles. For example, frog eggs have no shells to protect frog embryos from water pollutants, and adult frogs are often exposed to  \ninsecticides contained in many of the insects they eat. We explore these and other factors later in this chapter.\nWhy should we care if some \namphibian species become extinct? Scientists give three reasons. First,  \namphibians are sensitive biological indicators of changes in environmental conditions such as habitat loss, air and water pollution, ultraviolet (UV) radia-tion, and climate change. The growing threats to the survival of an increasing number of amphibian species indicate that environmental conditions are dete-riorating in many parts of the world.\nSecond, adult amphibians play \nimportant ecological roles in bio-  \nlogical communities. For example, amphibians eat more insects (includ-ing mosquitoes) than do birds. In some habitats, the extinction of cer -\ntain amphibian species could lead  \nto the extinction of other species of amphibians, as well as some aquatic insects, reptiles, birds, fish, and mam-mals that feed primarily on amphibi-ans or their larvae.\nThird, amphibians are  \na genetic storehouse of pharmaceutical products waiting to be discovered. For example, compounds  \nin secretions from the skin of certain amphibians have been isolated and used as painkillers and antibiotics, and in treatments for burns and heart disease.\nMany scientists believe \nthat the threats to amphibi-ans present a warning about a number of environmental threats to the earth\u2019s biodi-versity. In this chapter, we will learn about biodiver- sity, how it has arisen, why  it is important, and how it is threatened. We will also look at some possible solutions to these problems.\nWhy Are Amphibians Vanishing?\n64 Joel Sartore/National Geographic Creative\nFIGURE 4.1   Specimens of \nsome of the nearly 200 am-\nphibian species that have gone extinct since the 1970s.\n90446_ch04_062-081.indd   64 8/13/14   8:25 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Acting together, these four interacting compo-nents of the earth\u2019s biodiversity provide us with the ecosystem services (Figure 1.3, orange items, p. 7) that sustain our lives and economies and that tend to make ecosystems more resilient and adaptable.\nEstimates of the number of species on the earth range \nfrom 7 million to 100 million, with a best guess of 7\u201310 mil-lion species. So far, biologists have identified about 2 million species\u2014most of them being insects (Science Focus 4.1).\nSpecies diversity, the number and variety of the species \npresent in any biological community, is the most obvious component of biodiversity. Scientists think that ecosys-tems with high levels of species diversity tend to be more stable. Another important component is genetic diversity, the variety of genes found in a population or in a species (Figure 4.3), which enable the earth\u2019s species to survive and adapt to dramatic environmental changes.\nFunctional Diversity\nThe biological and chemical processes such as energyflow and matter recycling needed for the survival of species,communities, and ecosystems.\nEcological DiversityThe variety of terrestrial andaquatic ecosystems found inan area or on the earth.\nSpecies DiversityThe number and abundance of speciespresent in different communities.Genetic DiversityThe variety of genetic materialwithin a species or a population.\nChemical nutrients\n(carbon dioxide, \noxygen, nitrogen, \nminerals)\nDecomposers\n(bacteria, fungi)\nConsumers\n(plant eaters, \nmeat eaters)Solar\nenergy\nHeatHeat\nHeat\nHeat HeatProducers\n(plants)\nFIGURE 4.2   Natural capital: The major components of the earth\u2019s biodiversity\u2014one of the planet\u2019s most \nimportant renewable resources and a key component of its natural capital (see Figure 1.3, p. 7) \n Question: Do you think we should protect the earth\u2019s biodiversity from harmful human activities?

Some people fear insects and many think the only good bug is a dead bug. They fail to recognize the vital roles insects play in helping to sustain life on the earth.\nFor example, pollination is a vital \necosystem service that allows flowering plants to reproduce sexually when pol-len grains are transferred from the flower of one plant to a receptive part of the flower of another plant of the same species. Many of the earth\u2019s plant flowering species depend on insects to pollinate their flowers (Figure 4.A, left). Also, insects that eat other insects\u2014such as the praying mantis (Figure 4.A, right)\u2014help to control the populations of at least half the insect species we call pests. This free source of pest con-trol is another vital ecosystem service.\nCertain environmental changes, \nsome of them caused by human activi-ties, are threatening insect populations and their ecosystem services around \nINSECTS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN OUR WORLD\nthe world. Entomologists\u2014scientists who study insects\u2014are expanding their research in areas related to such envi-ronmental threats. For example, ento-mologist Diana Cox-Foster of \npennsylvania State University is study-\ning the decline of honeybees, which are extremely important pollinators. This decline threatens to disrupt whole ecosystems that depend on bees for pollination, as well as much of the hu-man food supply. We discuss this seri-ous environmental problem more fully in Chapter 8.\nCritical Thinking\nCan you think of three insect species not discussed above that benefit your life?ScienceFocus4.1\nFIGURE 4.A   Importance of insects: Bees \n(left) and numerous other insects pollinate \nflowering plants that serve as food for many plant eaters, including humans.

He \nbecame one of the world\u2019s experts on ants and then steadily widened his focus, eventually to include the entire biosphere. One of Wilson\u2019s landmark works is \nThe Diversity of Life,  \npublished in 1992, in which he presented the principles and practical issues of biodiversity more completely than anyone had to that point. He is now deeply involved in writing and lecturing about the need for global conservation efforts and is promoting the goal of com-pleting a global survey of biodiversity.\nWilson has won more than 100 national and international awards and has written  \n28 books, two of which won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. About the importance of biodiversity, he writes: \u201cHow can we save Earth\u2019s life forms from extinction if we don\u2019t even know what most of them are? . . .

Scientists describe the role that a species plays in its ecosystem as its ecological niche, or simply niche. It is a species\u2019 way of life in a community and includes every-thing that affects its survival and reproduction, such as how much water and sunlight it needs, how much space it requires, what it feeds on, what feeds on it, and the tem-peratures and other conditions it can tolerate. A species\u2019 niche should not be confused with its habitat, which is the place, or type of ecosystem, in which it lives.\nScientists use the niches of species to classify them \nmostly as generalists or specialists. Generalist species such \nas raccoons have broad niches (Figure 4.5, right curve). They can live in many different places, eat a variety of foods, and often tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. Other generalist species are flies, cockroaches, rats, white-tailed deer, and humans.In contrast, specialist species such as the giant panda \noccupy narrow niches (Figure 4.5, left curve). They may be able to live in only one type of habitat, use only one or a few types of food, or tolerate a narrow range of environ-mental conditions. For example, some shorebirds are spe-cialized to feed on crustaceans, insects, or other organisms found on sandy beaches and their adjoining coastal wet-lands (Figure 4.6).\nBecause of their narrow niches, specialists are more \nprone to extinction when environmental conditions change. For example, China\u2019s giant panda (Figure 4.5, left) is highly endangered because of a combination of habitat loss, low birth rate, and its specialized diet consisting mostly of bamboo.\nIs it better to be a generalist or a specialist? It depends. \nWhen environmental conditions are fairly constant, as in a tropical rain forest, specialists have an advantage because they have fewer competitors. But under rapidly changing environmental conditions, the more adaptable generalist usually is better off.\nSpecies Can Play Four Major Roles  \nwithin Ecosystems\nNiches can be classified further in terms of specific roles \nthat certain species play within ecosystems. Ecologists de-scribe native, nonnative, indicator, and keystone roles. Any \ngiven species may play one or more of these four roles in a particular ecosystem (Concept 4.2B).\nNative species are those species that normally live \nand thrive in a particular ecosystem. Other species that migrate into, or are deliberately or accidentally introduced into an ecosystem are called nonnative species, also re-ferred to as invasive, alien, and exotic species.\nPeople often think of nonnative species as threatening. \nIn fact, most domesticated species, including many food crops, flowers, chickens, cattle, and fish, benefit people in the areas where they were introduced. However, some nonnative species can compete with and reduce an ecosys-tem\u2019s native species, causing unintended and unexpected consequences. In 1957, for example, Brazil imported wild African honeybees to help increase honey production, but the bees displaced some native honeybee populations, which led to a reduced honey supply. Also, these bees are aggressive and unpredictable and have killed thousands of domesticated animals and an estimated 1,000 people in the western hemisphere, many of whom were", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3759, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f71defc8-a81a-43a1-91db-ec65728d27c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f71defc8-a81a-43a1-91db-ec65728d27c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "G.

For example, in this chapter\u2019s Core Case Study, we learned that some amphibians are classified as indicator species. One reason for this is that a 2005 study found an apparent correlation between climate change caused by atmospheric warming and the extinction of about two-thirds of the 110 known species of harlequin frogs in tropical forests of Central and South America.\nThe decline of amphibian populations likely results \nfrom a number of factors. Scientists have fanned out to several fronts to explore some of the possible causes (Sci-ence Focus 4.2).\nKeystone Species Play Critical Roles in \nTheir Ecosystems\nKeystone species are species whose roles have a large \neffect on the types and abundance of other species in an ecosystem. Many of these species occur in small and dwin-dling numbers, so some keystone species are more vulner -\nable to extinction than other species are.\nKeystone species can play several critical roles in help-\ning to sustain ecosystems. One such role is the pollination of flowering plant species by butterflies, honeybees (Figure 4.A), hummingbirds, bats, and other species. In addition, top predator keystone species feed on and help to regulate the populations of other species. Examples are wolves, leopards, lions, the American alligator (see the following Case Study), and some shark species (see second Case Study that follows).\nThe loss of a keystone species can lead to population \ncrashes and extinctions of other species in a community that depends on them for certain ecosystem services. This is why it so important for scientists to identify keystone species and for us to protect them.\nCASE STUDY\nThe American Alligator\u2014A Keystone \nSpecies That Almost Went Extinct\nThe American alligator (Figure 4.7) is a keystone species \nbecause it plays a number of important roles in the ecosys-tems where it is found in the southeastern United States.\nIn the 1930s, hunters began killing large numbers of \nthese animals for their exotic meat and their soft belly skin, used to make expensive shoes, belts, and pocket-books. Other people hunted alligators for sport or out of dislike for the large reptile. By the 1960s, hunters and poachers had wiped out 90% of the alligators in the state of Louisiana, and the alligator population in the Florida Everglades was also near extinction.\nThose who did not care much for the alligator might \nnot have been aware of its important ecological role\u2014its niche\u2014in subtropical wetland ecosystems. Alligators dig deep depressions, or gator holes. These depressions hold freshwater during dry spells, serve as refuges for aquatic life, and supply freshwater and food for fishes, insects, snakes, turtles, birds, and other animals.\nThe large nesting mounds that alligators build provide \nnesting and feeding sites for some herons and egrets, and red-bellied turtles lay their eggs in old gator nests. In addi-tion, alligators eat large numbers of gar, a predatory fish, which helps to maintain populations of game fish such as bass and bream that the gar eat.\nAs alligators create gator holes and nesting mounds, \nthey help to keep shore and open water areas free of in-FIGURE 4.6   Various bird species in a coastal wetland occupy specialized feeding niches.

One of the natural causes is parasites such as flatworms that feed on certain amphibian eggs. Scientists think this has caused birth defects such as missing limbs or extra limbs in some amphibians.\nSome herpetologists hypothesize \nthat viral and fungal diseases, espe-\ncially the chytrid fungus (Figure 4.B) that attacks the skin of frogs, are re-ducing the frogs\u2019 ability to ingest water through their skin. This leads to death from dehydration. Such diseases can spread fairly easily, because adults of many amphibian species congregate in large numbers to breed.\nAnother major threat to amphibians \nis habitat loss and fragmentation. This \nis mostly a human-caused problem re-sulting from the clearing of forests and the draining and filling of freshwater wetlands for farming and urban devel-opment. Another threat is prolonged drought, which can dry up breeding pools that frogs and other amphibians depend on for reproduction and sur -\nvival through their early stages of life (Figure 4.C).\nAnother human-influenced problem \nis higher levels of UV radiation, which \ncan harm embryos of amphibians in shallow ponds as well as adults bask-ing in the sun for warmth. Historically, such radiation has been screened by ozone in the stratosphere, but during the past few decades, ozone-depleting chemicals released into the tropo-sphere from human sources have drifted upward into the stratosphere and destroyed some of the protective ozone found there.Pollution is another human-caused \nthreat to amphibians. Frogs and other species are increasingly exposed to pes-ticides in ponds and in the bodies of insects that they eat. This can make them more vulnerable to bacterial, vi-ral, and fungal diseases and to some parasites. Amphibian expert and \n National Geographic Explorer Tyrone Hayes, a professor of biology at \n University of California, Berkeley, is conducting research on how some \n pesticides can harm frogs and other animals by disrupting their endocrine systems.\nOverhunting is another problem, es-\npecially in areas of Asia and Europe, where frogs are hunted for their leg SCIENTISTS ARE SEARCHING FOR THE CAUSES OF AMPHIBIAN DECLINES\nmeat. Yet another threat is the invasion of amphibian habitats by nonnative predators and competitors, such as certain fish species.

Without this free ecosystem service, \nfreshwater ponds and coastal wetlands where alligators live would be filled in with shrubs and trees, and dozens of species would disappear from these ecosystems. For these reasons, most ecologists classify the American alliga-tor as a keystone species vital to the sustainability of the ecosystems in which it is found.\nIn 1967, the U.S. government placed the American al-\nligator on the endangered species list. By 1977, because it was protected, its populations had made a strong enough comeback to be removed from the endangered species list. Today, there are well over a million alligators in Florida. The state now allows property owners to kill alligators that stray onto their land.\nTo conservation biologists, the comeback of the Ameri-\ncan alligator is an important success story in wildlife con-servation. Recently, however, large and rapidly reproducing Burmese and African pythons released deliberately or ac-cidently by humans have invaded the Florida Everglades, as discussed in Chapter 8. These nonnative invaders are capable of feeding on young alligators and thus could threaten the long-term survival of the American alligators of the Everglades.\nCASE STUDY\nWhy Should We Protect Sharks?\nAs keystone species, certain shark species play crucial roles in \nhelping to keep their ecosystems functioning. Sharks that feed at or near the tops of their food webs remove injured and sick animals from the ocean. Without this free ecosys-tem service, the oceans would be teeming with dead and dying fish and marine mammals.\nFIGURE 4.7   Keystone species: The American alligator plays an important ecological role in its marsh \nand swamp habitats in the southeastern United States.\nMartha Marks/Shutterstock.comThe American alligator plays \na key role in its habitat. \n90446_ch04_062-081.indd   71 8/13/14   8:25 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Every year, mem-bers of a few species, including the great white, bull, tiger, oceanic white tip, and hammerhead sharks, injure 60\u201375 people and typically kill 6\u201310 people worldwide. For every shark that injures or kills a person, people kill about 1.2 million sharks. As many as 73 million sharks are caught each year for their valuable fins and then thrown back alive into the water, fins re-moved, to bleed to death or drown because they can no longer swim. Sharks are also killed for their livers, meat, hides, and jaws, and because we fear them.\nHarvested shark fins are used widely in Asia as an in-\ngredient in expensive soup (up to $100 a bowl) and as a supposed pharmaceutical cure-all. According to the wild-life conservation group WildAid, there is no reliable evi-dence that the fins provide flavor or have any nutritional or medicinal value. The group also warns that consump-tion of shark fins and shark meat can threaten human health because these foods often contain very high levels of mercury and other toxins.\nAccording to a 2014 IUCN study, 25% of the world\u2019s \nopen-ocean shark species are threatened with extinction (Figure 4.8), primarily due to overfishing. Sharks are espe-cially vulnerable to population declines because they grow slowly, mature late, and have only a few offspring per generation. Today, they are among the earth\u2019s most vul-nerable and least protected animals.\nWith research support from the National Geographic \nSociety, biologist Samuel H. Gruber has been studying lemon sharks in the Florida Keys and the Bahamas, pri-marily focusing on the Florida East Coast from Palm Beach to Cape Canaveral. His goal is to help us understand and reduce the slaughter of these sharks, which he calls \u201cfan-tastic and amazing creatures.\u201d Protecting sharks is one way for us to live more sustainably by increasing our beneficial environmental impacts.\n4.3 HOW DOES THE EARTH\u2019S LIFE \nCHANGE OVER TIME?\nCONCEPT 4.3A   The scientific theory of evolution through \nnatural selection explains how life on the earth changes \nover time due to changes in the genes of populations.\nCONCEPT 4.3B   populations evolve when genes mutate \nand give some individuals genetic traits that enhance their abilities to survive and to produce offspring with these traits (natural selection).\nBiological Evolution by Natural Selection \nExplains How Life Changes over Time\nMost of what we know about the long history of life on \nthe earth comes from fossils: mineralized or petrified rep-licas of skeletons, bones, teeth, shells, leaves, and seeds, or impressions of such items found in rocks.

This record is un-even and incomplete because many forms of life left no fossils and some fossils have decomposed. Scientists esti-mate that the fossils found so far represent probably only 1% of all species that have ever lived.\nHow did we end up with such an amazing diversity of \nspecies? The scientific answer is biological evolution (or simply evolution): the process whereby the earth\u2019s life \nchanges over time through changes in the genes of popu-lations of organisms in succeeding generations. According to this scientific theory, species have evolved from earlier, ancestral species through natural selection. In this \n process, individuals with certain genetic traits are more likely to survive and reproduce under a particular set of environmental conditions, and to pass these traits on to their offspring, than are individuals without these traits (Concept 4.3B).\nA large body of evidence supports this idea. As a result, \nbiological evolution through natural selection has become a widely accepted scientific theory that generally explains how life has changed over the past 3.8 billion years and why life is so diverse today (Concept 4.3A). However, there are still many unanswered questions about some of the details of evolution by natural selection, and research continues in this area.\nBiological Evolution by Natural Selection \nDepends on Genetic Diversity\nThe idea that organisms change over time and are de-\nscended from a single common ancestor has been around in one form or another since the time of the early Greek philosophers. But no one had developed an explanation of how this could happen until 1858 when naturalists Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) and Alfred Russel Wallace (1823\u20131913) independently proposed the concept of natural selec-tion as a mechanism for biological evolution. Darwin meticulously gathered evidence for this idea and published it in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natu-ral Selection.\nBiological evolution by natural selection involves \nchanges in a population\u2019s genetic makeup through succes-sive generations. Recall that a population is a group of indi-viduals of the same species living in a particular space. Note that populations\u2014not individuals\u2014evolve by becoming genetically different.\nThe first step in this process is the development of ge-\nnetic variability, or variety in the genetic makeup of indi-viduals in a population. This occurs through mutations: changes in the DNA molecules of a gene in any cell that can be inherited by offspring. During an organism\u2019s life-time, the DNA in its cells (see Figure 10, p. S10, Supple-ment 3) is copied each time one of its cells divides and whenever it reproduces\u2014millions of times, in all. Most mutations result from random changes in the DNA\u2019s coded genetic instructions that occur in some tiny fraction of these millions of times. Some mutations also occur from exposure to external agents such as radioactivity, ultravio-let radiation from the sun, and certain natural and human-made chemicals (called mutagens).\nMutations can occur in any cell, but only those that \ntake place in the genes of reproductive cells are passed on to offspring. Sometimes a mutation can result in a new genetic trait, called a heritable trait, which can be passed from one generation to the next. In this way, populations develop genetic differences among their individuals. Some mutations are harmful to offspring and some are beneficial.\nThe next step in biological evolution is natural selection, \nin which environmental conditions favor some individuals over others. The favored individuals possess heritable traits that give them some advantage over other individuals in a given population.

Such a trait is called an adaptation, or adaptive trait\u2014any heritable trait that improves the abil-ity of an individual organism to survive and to reproduce at a higher rate than other individuals in a population are able to do under prevailing environmental conditions. Thus, the scientific concept of natural selection explains how populations adapt to changes in environmental con-ditions by changing their overall genetic makeup.\nAn example of natural selection at work is genetic resis-\ntance\u2014the ability of one or more organisms in a popula-tion to tolerate a chemical such as a pesticide or antibiotic designed to kill it and to reproduce more rapidly than the members of the population that do not have such genetic traits. Genetic resistance can develop fairly quickly in populations of organisms such as many species of bacteria and insects that can rapidly produce large numbers of off-spring. For example, certain disease-causing bacteria have developed genetic resistance to widely used antibacterial drugs, or antibiotics (Figure 4.9).\nOur own species is another example of evolution by \nnatural selection. We have evolved certain traits that have allowed us to dominate most of the earth\u2019s land area and many of its aquatic systems. Evolutionary biologists attri-bute our success to three major adaptations: strong oppos-able thumbs that allowed us to grip and use tools better than the few other animals that have thumbs could do; an ability to walk upright, which gave us agility and freed up our hands for many uses; and a complex brain, which al-lowed us to develop many skills, including the ability to use speech and to read and write in order to transmit com-plex ideas.\nTo summarize the process of biological evolution by \nnatural selection: Genes mutate, individuals are selected, and the resulting populations are better adapted to survive and repro-duce under existing environmental conditions (Concept 4.3B).\n90446_ch04_062-081.indd   73 8/13/14   8:25 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

First, a change in environmental conditions can \nlead to such an adaptation only for genetic traits already present in a population\u2019s gene pool or for traits resulting from mutations, which occur randomly.\nSecond, even if a beneficial heritable trait is present in a \npopulation, the population\u2019s ability to adapt may be lim-ited by its reproductive capacity. Populations of genetically diverse species that reproduce quickly\u2014such as weeds, mosquitoes, rats, bacteria, and cockroaches\u2014often adapt to a change in environmental conditions in a short time (days to years). By contrast, species that cannot produce large numbers of offspring rapidly\u2014such as elephants, ti-gers, sharks, and humans\u2014take a much longer time (typi-cally thousands or even millions of years) to adapt through natural selection.\nSome Common Myths about Evolution \nthrough Natural Selection\nThere are a number of misconceptions about biological \nevolution through natural selection. Here are four com-mon ones:\n\u2022\tSurvival of the fittest means survival of the strongest. To \nbiologists, fitness is a measure of reproductive success, \nnot strength. Thus, the fittest individuals are those  \nthat leave the most descendants, not those that are physically the strongest.\u2022\tEvolution explains the origin of life. It does not. However, it does explain how species have evolved after life came into being.\n\u2022\tHumans evolved from apes or monkeys. Actually, humans, apes, and monkeys evolved along different paths from a common ancestor that lived 5\u20138 million years ago.\n\u2022\tEvolution by natural selection involves a grand plan of nature in which species are to become more perfectly adapted.  \nThere is no evidence of any such plan. Instead, evidence indicates that the forces of natural selection and random mutations can push evolution along any number of paths.\n4.4 WHAT FACTORS AFFECT \nBIODIVERSITY?\nCONCEPT 4.4A   As environmental conditions change, the \nbalance between the formation of new species and the ex-\ntinction of existing species determines the earth\u2019s biodiversity.\nCONCEPT 4.4B   Human activities are decreasing biodiver -\nsity by causing the extinction of many species and by de-stroying or degrading habitats needed for the development of new species through natural selection.\nHow Do New Species Arise?\nUnder certain circumstances, natural selection can lead to \nan entirely new species. In this process, called speciation, one species splits into two or more different species. For sexually reproducing organisms, a new species forms when one population of a species has evolved to the point where its members can no longer breed and produce fer -\ntile offspring with members of another population that did not change or that evolved differently.\nNormal bacterium Resistant bacteriuma. b. c. d.\nFIGURE 4.9   Evolution by natural selection: (a) A population of bacteria is exposed to an antibiotic, \nwhich (b) kills all individuals except those possessing a trait that makes them resistant to the drug.  \n(c) The resistant bacteria multiply and eventually (d) replace all or most of the nonresistant bacteria.\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\n90446_ch04_062-081.indd   74 8/13/14   8:25 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This happens in two phases: first geographic isola-tion, and then reproductive isolation.\nGeographic isolation occurs when different groups of \nthe same population of a species become physically isolated from one another for a long period of time. For example, part of a population may migrate in search of food and then begin living as a separate population in another area with differ-ent environmental conditions. Populations can also be sepa-rated by a physical barrier (such as a flooding stream or a new road), a volcanic eruption, geological processes (Science \n Focus 4.3), or winds or flowing water that carry a few in-dividuals to a distant area. These separated populations can develop quite different characteristics. For example, populations of poison dart frogs (Core Case Study) living on different islands or in different parts of a region can have dramatic differences in coloration, as shown in Figure 4.10.\nIn reproductive isolation, mutation and change by \nnatural selection operate independently in the gene pools of geographically isolated populations. If this process con-tinues for a long enough time, members of the geographi-cally and reproductively isolated populations of sexually reproducing species can become so different in genetic makeup that they cannot produce live, fertile offspring if they are rejoined and attempt to interbreed. As a result, one species has become two, and speciation has occurred (Figure 4.11).\nScientists have found fascinating ways to study specia-\ntion and evolution. For example, molecular biologist and Emerging National Geographic Explorer Beth Shapiro an-alyzes DNA samples from the fossils of ancient animals and plants and uses statistical models to discover the course of evolution of populations over time and territory. Such re-search can pinpoint changes in the genetic diversity of populations, as well as extinctions and speciation resulting from factors such as new predators and changes in habitat and climate. This information could be used to help devise strategies for protecting species today.\nHumans are having an increasingly larger effect on the \nearth\u2019s biodiversity by manipulating and combining the genes of species. We have used artificial selection to \nchange the genetic characteristics of populations with similar genes. In this process, we select one or more desirable genetic traits in the population of a plant or ani-mal such as a type of wheat, fruit, or dog. Then we use selective breed-ing, or crossbreeding, to generate populations of the species con-taining large numbers of individu-als with the desired traits.\nNote that artificial selection \ninvolves crossbreeding between genetic varieties of the same spe-cies or between species that are genetically close to one another, and thus it is not a form of specia-tion. Most of the grains, fruits, and vegetables we eat are pro-duced by artificial selection. It has also given us food crops with higher yields, cows that give more milk, trees that grow faster, and many different types of dogs and cats. But traditional crossbreeding is a slow process and it can be used only on species that are ge-netically similar to one another.\nNow scientists are using ge-\nnetic engineering to speed up our ability to manipulate genes. In this process, scientists alter an or -\nganism\u2019s genetic material by add-\nFIGURE 4.10   These poison dart frogs vary in coloration, partly because they were exposed to differ -\nent environmental conditions.

For ex-ample, scientists have used genetic engineering to develop modified crop plants, new drugs, pest-resistant plants, and animals that grow rapidly (Figure 4.12).\nGenetic engineering also enables scientists to transfer \ngenes between different species that would not interbreed in nature. For example, we can put genes from a cold-water fish species into a tomato plant to give it properties that help it to resist cold weather.\nA new and rapidly growing form of genetic engineer -\ning is synthetic biology. It is a technology that enables scientists to make new sequences of DNA and to use such genetic information to design and create new cells, tissues, \nThe earth\u2019s surface has changed dra-\nmatically over its long history. Scientists \nhave discovered that huge flows of molten rock within the earth\u2019s interior have broken its surface into a number of gigantic solid plates, called tectonic plates. For hundreds of millions of years, these plates have drifted slowly on the planet\u2019s mantle (Figure 4.D).\nrock and fossil evidence indicates \nthat 200\u2013250 million years ago, all  \nof the earth\u2019s present-day continents  \nwere connected in a supercontinent called \npangaea (Figure 4.D, left). About \n135 million years ago, pangaea began \nsplitting apart as the earth\u2019s tectonic plates moved, eventually resulting in the present-day locations of the conti-nents (Figure 4.D, right).The fact that tectonic plates drift \nhas had two important effects on the evolution and distribution of life on the earth. First, the locations of continents \nand oceanic basins have greatly influ-enced the earth\u2019s climate and thus have helped to determine where plants and animals can live. Second, the breakup, movement, and joining of continents has allowed species to move, adapt to new environments, and form new species through speciation.\nAdjoining tectonic plates that are \ngrinding along slowly next to one an-other sometimes shift quickly. Such sudden movement of tectonic plates can cause earthquakes, which can also affect biological evolution by causing fissures in the earth\u2019s crust that, on rare occasions, can separate and isolate GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES AFFECT BIODIVERSITY\npopulations of species. Over long peri-ods, this can lead to the formation of new species as each isolated popula-tion changes genetically in response to new environmental conditions. Volca-nic eruptions that occur along the boundaries of tectonic plates can also affect extinction and speciation by \n destroying habitats and reducing, iso-lating, or wiping out populations of species. We discuss these processes  \nin greater detail in Chapter 12.\nCritical Thinking\nThe earth\u2019s tectonic plates, including the one you are riding on, typically move at about the rate at which your fingernails grow.

When environmental conditions change dramati-cally or rapidly, a population of a species faces three possible futures: adapt to the new conditions through natural selection, migrate (if possible) to another area with more favorable conditions, or become extinct.\nSpecies that are found in only one area, called en-\ndemic species, are especially vulnerable to extinction. They exist on islands and in other unique areas, especially in tropical rain forests where most species have highly specialized roles. For these reasons, they are unlikely to be able to migrate or adapt in the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Many of these endangered species are amphibians (Core Case Study), such as the now-extinct golden toad (Figure 4.B).\nThroughout most of the earth\u2019s long his-\ntory, species have disappeared at a low rate, called the background extinction rate\u2014\nthe rate that existed before the human \n population began growing exponentially. In contrast, a mass extinction is a significant rise in extinction rates above the back-ground rate. In such a catastrophic, wide-spread, and often global event, large groups of species (25\u201395% of all species) are wiped \nout, primarily because of major, widespread environ-mental changes. Fossil and geological evidence indicate that there have been at least three and probably five mass extinctions (at intervals of 20\u201360 million years) during the past 500 million years (see Supplement 6, p. S49).\nA mass extinction provides an opportunity for the evo-\nlution of new species that can fill unoccupied ecological niches or newly created ones. Scientific evidence indicates that each occurrence of mass extinction has been followed by an increase in species diversity over several million years as new species have arisen to occupy new habitats or to exploit newly available resources.\nAs environmental conditions change, the balance be-\ntween speciation and extinction determines the earth\u2019s biodiversity (Concept 4.4A).

However, evidence indicates that the global extinction rate is rising dramatically (as we discuss more fully in Chapter 8). Many scientists argue that this and other evidence indicate that we are experiencing the beginning of a new sixth mass extinction (see Supplement 6, p. S49).\nThere is also considerable evidence that much of the \ncurrent rise in the extinction rate and the resulting loss of biodiversity are primarily due to human activities (Con-cept 4.4B), as our ecological footprints spread over the planet (see Figure 1.10, p. 12). Research indicates that the largest cause of the rising rate of species extinctions is  \nthe loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitats. We examine this issue further in Chapters 8 and 9.\nThis chapter\u2019s  Core Case Study on amphibians re-\nports on the increasing losses of amphibian species and ex-\nplains why these species are important, ecologically. In this chapter, we studied the importance of biodiversity\u2014the numbers and varieties of species found in different parts of the world, along with genetic, ecosystem, and functional diversity.\nWe examined the variety of niches and roles played by \nspecies in ecosystems. For example, we saw that some spe-cies, including many amphibians, are indicator species that clue us in to the presence of threats to biodiversity, to ecosys-tems, and to the biosphere. Others such as the American al-ligator and some shark species are keystone species that play vital roles in sustaining the ecosystems where they live.\nWe also studied the process whereby all species came to \nbe, according to the scientific theory of biological evolution through natural selection and how new species can arise. We learned that the earth\u2019s biodiversity is the result of a balance between the formation of new species (speciation) and ex-tinctions of existing species in response to changing environ-mental conditions.\nThe ecosystems where amphibians and other species live \nare functioning examples of the three scientific prin-ciples of sustainability in action. They depend on so-lar energy, the cycling of nutrients, and biodiversity. Disrup-  \ntions in any of these forms of natural capital can result in degradation of these species\u2019 populations and their ecosystems.TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nAmphibians and Sustainability\nRobert King/Shutterstock.com\u2022 Each species plays a specific ecological role, \ncalled its niche, in the ecosystems where it is \nfound.\n\u2022 As environmental conditions change, the genes \nin some individuals mutate and give those \nindividuals genetic traits that enhance their abilities to survive and to produce offspring with these traits.\n\u2022\n The degree of balance between speciation and \nextinction in response to changing environmental \nconditions determines the earth\u2019s biodiversity, which helps to sustain the earth\u2019s life and our economies.BIG IDEAS\n90446_ch04_062-081.indd   78 8/13/14   8:25 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Distinguish between geographic \nisolation and reproductive isolation, and explain how they can lead to the formation of a new species. Explain how geological processes can affect biodiver -\nsity. Define and distinguish between artificial selec-tion and genetic engineering and give an example of each. Define synthetic biology.\n 9. What is extinction? What is an endemic species  \nand why can such a species be vulnerable to extinc-tion? Define and distinguish between the back-ground extinction rate and a mass extinction. What is one of the leading causes of the rising rate of extinction?\n 10. What are this chapter\u2019s three big ideas? How are eco-systems where amphibians and other species live functioning examples of the three scientific principles of sustainability?\nnote: Key terms are in bold type.\nCritical Thinking\n 1. How might we and other species be affected if most or all amphibians (Core Case Study) were to go extinct?\n 2. Is the human species a keystone species? Explain. If humans were to become extinct, what are three spe-cies that might also become extinct and what are three species whose populations would probably grow? 3. If you were forced to choose between saving the gi-ant panda from extinction and saving a shark species, which would you choose? Explain.\n 4. How would you respond to someone who tells you that:\n a. he or she does not believe in biological evolution because it is \u201cjust a theory\u201d?\n b. we should not worry about air pollution because natural selection will enable humans to develop lungs that can detoxify pollutants?\n90446_ch04_062-081.indd   79 8/13/14   8:25 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Most of the remain-ing members of this endangered spe-cies are found off the western coast of the United States between the cities of Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara, California.\nSouthern sea otters are fast and \nagile swimmers that dive to the ocean bottom looking for shellfish and other prey, including sea urchins. On the surface they swim on their backs and feed on their prey, using their bellies as a table (Figure 5.1, left). Each day,  \na sea otter consumes 20\u201335% of its weight in clams, mussels, crabs, sea urchins, abalone, and about 40 other species of bottom-dwelling organisms.\nIt is estimated that between 13,000 \nand 20,000 southern sea otters once lived in California\u2019s coastal waters. By the early 1900s, they were hunted almost to extinction in this region by fur traders who killed them for their thick, luxurious fur. Commercial fish\n-\nerman also killed otters because they viewed them as competitors in the hunt for valuable abalone and other shellfish.\nSince that time this population has \ngenerally grown from a low of about 50 in 1938 to an estimated 2,941 in 2013. Their partial recovery got a boost in 1977 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared the species endangered in most of its range, with a total population of only 1,850 indi-viduals. Despite such progress, the population has a long way to go to justify removing it from the endan-gered species list.\nWhy should we care about the \nsouthern sea otters of California? One reason is ethical: many people believe it is wrong to allow human activities to cause the extinction of a species. Another reason is that peo-ple love to look at these appealing and highly intelli-gent animals as they play in the water. As a result, they help to generate millions of dollars a year in tourism revenues. A third rea-son\u2014and a key reason in our study  \nof environmental science\u2014is that \n biologists classify them as a keystone \n species (see p. 69). Scientists hypothe-size that in the absence of southern sea otters, sea urchins and other kelp-eating species would probably destroy the Pacific coast kelp forests and much of the rich biodiversity they support.\nBiodiversity is an important part of \nthe earth\u2019s natural capital and is the focus of one of the three scientific principles of sustainability. In this chapter, we will look at how species interact and help control one another\u2019s population sizes and how communities, ecosystems, and populations of species respond to changes in environmental conditions.The Southern Sea Otter: A Species in Recovery\n84 \nFIGURE 5.1   An endangered southern sea otter in Monterey Bay, California \n(USA) uses a stone to crack the shells of the clams that it feeds on (left).

These types of interactions are called interspecific competition, predation, parasitism, mutual-\nism, and commensalism, and they all have significant effects on the population sizes of the species in an ecosystem and on how they use resources (Concept 5.1).\nThe most common interaction among species is compe-\ntition, which occurs when members of one or more species interact to use the same limited resources such as food, water, light, and space. Competition within a species is called intraspecific competition, but interspecific competi-\ntion, or competition among different species, plays a larger role in most ecosystems. Most interspecific competi-tion involves one species becoming more efficient than others in obtaining the resources it needs.\nWhen two species compete with one another for the \nsame resources, their niches overlap (see Figure 4.5, p. 68). The greater this overlap, the more they compete for key resources. If one species can take over the largest share of one or more key resources, each of the other competing species must move to another area (if possible), adapt by shifting its feeding habits or behavior through natural se-lection to reduce or alter its niche, suffer a sharp popula-tion decline, or become extinct in that area.\nHumans compete with many other species for space, \nfood, and other resources. As our ecological footprints grow and spread (see Figure 1.10, p. 12), we are taking over or degrading the habitats of many other species and depriving them of resources they need in order to survive.\nOver a time scale long enough for natural selection to \noccur, populations of some species develop adaptations that allow them to reduce or avoid competition with other species for resources. One way this happens is through resource partitioning, which occurs when species com-peting for similar scarce resources evolve specialized traits that allow them to share resources by using parts of them, using them at different times, or using them in different ways. Figure 5.2 shows resource partitioning by some insect-eating bird species whose adaptations allow them to reduce competition by feeding in different portions of cer -\ntain spruce trees and by feeding on different insect species. Similarly, Figure 4.6 (p. 69) shows how the evolution of specialized feeding niches has reduced competition for re-sources among bird species in a coastal wetland.\nConsumer Species Feed on Other Species\nIn predation, a member of one species (the predator, or \nhunter) feeds directly on all or part of a living organism (the prey, or hunted) as part of a food web. Together, the \ntwo different species\u2014such as a lion, the predator, and a zebra, its prey (see Figure 3.6, p. 46)\u2014are engaged in a \nBlackburnian Warbler Black-throated Green Warbler Cape May Warbler Bay-breasted Warbler Yellow-rumped Warbler\nFIGURE 5.2   Sharing the wealth: Resource partitioning among five species of insect-eating warblers \nin the spruce forests of the U.S. state of Maine.

However, as a keystone species, southern sea otters (Core Case Study) prey on the sea urchins and help to keep them from de-stroying the kelp forests.\nPredators have a variety of methods that help them \ncapture prey. Herbivores can walk, swim, or fly to the plants they feed on. Carnivores such as the cheetah catch prey by running fast. Others, such as the American bald eagle, can fly and have keen eyesight. Still others work together to capture their prey, as female African lions often do in preying on zebras (see Figure 3.6, p. 46), wildebeest, ante-lopes, and other fast-running large animals of the open savannah grasslands.\nOther predators use camouflage to hide in plain sight \nand ambush their prey. For example, praying mantises (see Figure 4.A, right, p. 66) sit on flowers or plants of a color similar to their own and ambush visiting insects. White ermines (a type of weasel), snowy owls, and arctic foxes hunt their prey in snow-covered areas. People cam-ouflage themselves to hunt wild game and use camou-flaged traps to capture wild animals. Some predators use chemical warfare to attack their prey. For example, some spiders and poisonous snakes use venom to paralyze their prey and to deter their predators.\nPrey species have evolved many ways to avoid preda-\ntors, including abilities to run, swim, or fly fast, and some have highly developed senses of sight, sound, or smell that alert them to the presence of predators. Other adaptations include protective shells (as on armadillos and turtles), thick bark (on giant sequoia trees), spines (on porcupines), and thorns (on cacti and rose bushes).\nOther prey species use the camouflage of certain \nshapes or colors. Some insect species have shapes that look like twigs (Figure 5.3a), or bird droppings on leaves. A leaf insect can be almost invisible against its background (Fig-ure 5.3b), as can an arctic hare in its white winter fur.\nA kelp forest is composed of large \nconcentrations of a seaweed called \n giant kelp. Anchored to the ocean \nfloor, its long blades grow toward the sunlit surface waters (Figure 5.1, right). Under good conditions, the blades can grow 0.6 meter (2 feet) in a day and the plant can grow as tall as a ten-story building. The blades are very flex-ible and can survive all but the most violent storms and waves.\nKelp forests are one of the most bi-\nologically diverse ecosystems found in marine waters, supporting large num-bers of marine plants and animals. These forests help reduce shore erosion by blunting the force of incoming waves and trapping some of the out-going sand.\nSea urchins (Figure 5.A) prey on \nkelp plants. Large populations of these predators can rapidly devastate a kelp forest because they eat the bases of young kelp plants. Scientific studies by biologists, includ-ing James Estes of the University of California at Santa Cruz, indicate that the southern sea otter (Core Case Study) is a keystone spe-cies that helps to sustain kelp forests by controlling populations of sea urchins.\nA second threat to kelp forests is \npolluted water running off the land and into the coastal waters where kelp forests grow.

Some discourage predators by containing or emit-\nting chemicals that are poisonous (oleander plants), irritating  \n(stinging nettles and bombardier beetles, Figure 5.3c), foul smelling (skunks and stinkbugs), or bad tasting (buttercups and monarch butterflies, Figure 5.3d). When attacked, some species of squid and octopus emit clouds of black ink, allowing them to escape by confusing their predators.Many bad-tasting, bad-smelling, toxic, or stinging prey \nspecies have evolved warning coloration, brightly colored advertising that helps experienced predators to recognize and avoid them. They flash a warning: \u201cEating me is risky.\u201d Examples are the brilliantly colored, foul-tasting monarch butterflies (Figure 5.3d) and poisonous frogs (Figure 5.3e and Figure 4.10, p. 75). When a bird such as a blue jay eats a monarch butterfly, it usually vomits and learns to avoid monarchs.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Coloration and Dangerous Species\nBiologist edward O. Wilson gives us two rules for evaluating the possible dan-\ngers posed by various brightly-colored animal species. First, if they are small \nand strikingly beautiful, they are probably poisonous. Second,  if they are strik-\ningly beautiful and easy to catch, they are probably deadly.\nSome butterfly species gain protection by looking and \nacting like other, more dangerous species, a protective de-vice known as mimicry. For example, the nonpoisonous viceroy butterfly (Figure 5.3f) mimics the monarch but-terfly. Other prey species use behavioral strategies to avoid predation. Some attempt to scare off predators by puffing up (blowfish), spreading their wings (peacocks), or mim-icking a predator (Figure 5.3h). Some moths have wings that look like the eyes of much larger animals (Figure 5.3g). Other prey species gain some protection by living in large groups such as schools of fish and herds of antelope.\nInteractions between Predator and Prey \nSpecies Can Drive Each Other\u2019s Evolution\nAt the individual level, members of the predator species \nbenefit from their predation and members of the prey spe-cies are harmed. At the population level, predation plays a role in natural selection. Animal predators, for example, tend to kill the sick, weak, aged, and least fit members of a prey population because they are the easiest to catch. Individuals with better defenses against predation thus tend to survive longer and leave more offspring with ad-aptations that can help them avoid predation. Over time, as a prey species develops traits that make it more difficult to catch, its predators face selection pressures that favor traits increasing their ability to catch their prey. Then the prey species must get better at eluding the more effective predators.\nWhen populations of two different species interact in \nsuch a way over a long period of time, changes in the gene pool of populations one species can lead to changes in the gene pool of the other. Such changes can help both com-peting species to become more competitive or to avoid or reduce competition. Biologists call this natural selection process coevolution.\nFor example, bats prey on certain species of moths, and \nthey hunt at night using echolocation, emitting pulses of \n(a) Span worm (b) W andering leaf insect\n(c) Bombardier beetle (d) Foul-tasting\n monarch butter/f_ly\n(f) V iceroy butter/f_ly mimics \n monarch butter/f_ly(e) Poison dart frog\n(g) Hind wings of Io moth\n r esemble eyes of a\n much larger animal(h) When touched, snake caterpillar changes shape to look like head of snake\nFIGURE 5.3   These prey", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3637, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2a624c5-2785-4554-b084-190367b27bab": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2a624c5-2785-4554-b084-190367b27bab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "G.

Over time, certain moth species have evolved ears that are especially sensitive to the sound frequencies that bats use to find them. When they hear these frequencies, they try to escape by dropping to the ground or flying eva-sively. Some bat species have evolved ways to counter this defense by changing the frequency of their sound pulses. In turn, some moths have evolved their own high-frequency clicks to jam the bats\u2019 echolocation systems. Some bat spe-cies have then adapted by turning off their echolocation systems and using the moths\u2019 clicks to locate their prey.\nThus, the complex predator\u2013prey relationship plays an \nimportant role in controlling population growth of preda-tor and prey species, and it helps these species to thrive and to contribute to important ecosystem services. How-ever, these relationships and ecosystem services can be disrupted when nonnative predator species are intro-duced, either accidentally or deliberately, into ecosystems. We discuss the effects of such disruption in Chapter 8.\nSome Species Feed Off Other Species by \nLiving On or Inside Them\nParasitism occurs when one species (the parasite) feeds \non another organism (the host), usually by living on or inside the host. In this relationship, the parasite benefits and the host is often harmed.\nA parasite usually is much smaller than its host and \nrarely kills it. However, most parasites remain closely as-sociated with their hosts, draw nourishment from them, and may gradually weaken them.\nSome parasites such as tapeworms live inside their \nhosts. Others such as mistletoe plants and blood-sucking sea lampreys (Figure 5.4) attach themselves to the out-sides of their hosts. Some parasites, including fleas and ticks, move from one host to another while others, includ-ing tapeworms, spend their adult lives within a single host. Parasites harm their hosts but help to keep the populations of their hosts in check.\nIn Some Interactions, Both Species Benefit\nIn mutualism, two species behave in ways that benefit \nboth by providing each with food, shelter, or some other resource. One example is pollination of flowering plants by species such as honeybees, hummingbirds, and butter -\nflies that feed on the nectar of flowers (Figure 4.A, p. 66).\nFigure 5.5 shows an example of a mutualistic relation-\nship that combines nutrition and protection. It involves birds that ride on the backs or heads of large animals such as elephants, rhinoceroses, and impalas. The birds remove and eat parasites and pests (such as ticks and flies) from \nFIGURE 5.4   Parasitism: This blood-sucking, parasitic sea lamprey has \nattached itself to an adult lake trout from one of the Great Lakes \n(USA, Canada).\nGreat Lakes Fishery Commission\nFIGURE 5.5   Mutualism: Oxpeckers feed on parasitic ticks that infest \nanimals such as this impala and warn of approaching predators.Villiers Steyn/Dreamstime.com\n90446_ch05_082-099.indd   88 8/13/14   8:27 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The clownfish, which are not harmed by the tentacles, gain protection from predators and feed on the waste matter left from the anemones\u2019 meals. The sea anemones benefit because the clownfish protect them from some of their predators and parasites.\nIn gut inhabitant mutualism, armies of bacteria in the \ndigestive systems of animals help to break down (digest) the animals\u2019 food. In turn, the bacteria receive a sheltered habitat and food from their hosts. Hundreds of millions of bacteria in your gut secrete enzymes that help you digest the food you eat.\nIt is tempting to think of mutualism as an example of \ncooperation between species. In reality, the species in a mutualistic interaction benefit one another unintention-ally and are each in it for their own survival.\nIn Some Interactions, One Species Benefits \nand the Other Is Not Harmed\nCommensalism is an interaction that benefits one species \nbut has little, if any, beneficial or harmful effect on the other. One example involves plants called epiphytes (air plants), which attach themselves to the trunks or branches of trees (Figure 5.6) in tropical and subtropical forests. Epi-phytes benefit by having a solid base on which to grow in an elevated location that gives them better access to sun-light, water from the humid air and rain, and nutrients falling from the tree\u2019s upper leaves and limbs. Their pres-ence apparently does not harm the tree. Similarly, birds benefit by nesting in trees, generally without harming them.\n5.2 HOW DO COMMUNITIES AND \nECOSYSTEMS RESPOND TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS?\nCONCEPT 5.2   The species composition of a community or \necosystem can change in response to changing environmen-\ntal conditions through a process called ecological succession.\nCommunities and Ecosystems Change over \nTime: Ecological Succession\nThe types and numbers of species in biological communi-\nties and ecosystems change in response to changing envi-ronmental conditions such as a fires, volcanic eruptions, climate change, and the clearing of forests to plant crops. The normally gradual change in species composition in a given area is called ecological succession (Concept 5.2).\nEcologists recognize two major types of ecological suc-\ncession, depending on the conditions present at the begin-ning of the process. Primary ecological succession involves the gradual establishment of communities of dif-ferent species in lifeless areas where there is no soil in a terrestrial ecosystem or no bottom sediment in an aquatic ecosystem. Examples include bare rock exposed by a re-treating glacier (Figure 5.7), newly cooled lava, an aban-doned highway or parking lot, and a newly created shallow pond or reservoir. Primary succession usually takes hundreds to thousands of years because of the need \nFIGURE 5.6   Commensalism: this pitcher plant is attached to a \nbranch of a tree without penetrating or harming the tree.

However, living systems contain complex pro-cesses that interact to provide some degree of stability, or sustainability. This stability, or capacity to withstand exter -\nnal stress and disturbance, is maintained only by constant change in response to changing environmental conditions. For example, in a mature tropical rain forest, some trees die and others take their places. However, unless the forest is cut, burned, or otherwise destroyed, you would still recognize it as a tropical rain forest 50 or 100 years from now.\nIt is useful to distinguish between two aspects of stabil-\nity or sustainability in ecosystems. One is inertia, or per-sistence: the ability of an ecosystem to survive moderate disturbances. A second factor is resilience: the ability of to build up fertile soil or aquatic sediments to provide the nutrients needed to establish a plant community.\nThe other, more common type of ecological succession \nis called secondary ecological succession, in which a se-ries of communities or ecosystems with different species develop in places containing soil or bottom sediment. This type of succession begins in an area where an ecosystem has been disturbed, removed, or destroyed, but some soil or bot-tom sediment remains. Candidates for secondary succession include abandoned farmland (Figure 5.8), burned or cut forests, heavily polluted streams, and flooded land. Because some soil or sediment is present, new vegetation can begin to grow, usually within a few weeks. It begins with the ger -\nmination of seeds already in the soil and seeds imported by wind or in the droppings of birds and other animals.\nEcological succession is an important ecosystem service \nthat tends to enrich the biodiversity of communities and ecosystems by increasing species diversity and interactions among species. Such interactions in turn enhance sustain-ability by promoting population control and by increasing the complexity of food webs, which enhances energy flow and nutrient cycling.

For example, tropical rain forests have high species diversity and high inertia and thus are resistant to lower levels of change or damage. But once a large tract of tropical rain forest is cleared or severely damaged, the resilience of the resulting degraded forest ecosystem may be so low that it reaches an ecologi-cal tipping point after which it might not be restored by secondary ecological succession. One reason for this is that most of the nutrients in a typical rain forest are stored in its vegetation, not in the topsoil, as in most other terres-trial ecosystems. Once the nutrient-rich vegetation is gone, daily rains can remove most of the remaining soil nutrients and thus prevent the return of a tropical rain forest on a large cleared area.\nBy contrast, grasslands are much less diverse than most \nforests, and consequently they have low inertia and can burn easily. However, because most of their plant matter is stored in underground roots, these ecosystems have high resilience and can recover quickly after a fire, as their root systems produce new grasses. Grassland can be destroyed only if its roots are plowed up and something else is planted in its place, or if it is severely overgrazed by live-stock or other herbivores.\n5.3 WHAT LIMITS THE GROWTH OF \nPOPULATIONS?\nCONCEPT 5.3   No population can grow indefinitely be-\ncause of limitations on resources and because of competi-\ntion among species for those resources.\nPopulations Can Grow, Shrink,  \nor Remain Stable\nA population is a group of interbreeding individuals of \nthe same species (Figure 5.9).

Individuals within a population may also have slightly dif-ferent tolerance ranges for temperature or other physical or chemical factors because of small differences in their ge-netic makeup, health, and age. For example, a trout popu-lation may do best within a narrow band of temperatures (optimum level or range), but a few individuals can survive \nabove and below that band. However, if the water be-comes too hot or too cold, none of the trout can survive.\nA number of physical or chemical factors can help to \ndetermine the number of organisms in a population.

On land, precipitation often is the limiting factor. For example, low precipitation levels in desert ecosystems limit desert plant growth. Important limiting physical factors for populations in aquatic systems \ninclude water temperature (Figure 5.10), water depth and clarity (allowing for more or less sunlight), nutrient avail-ability, acidity, salinity, and the level of oxygen gas in the water (dissolved oxygen content).\nToo much of a physical or chemical factor can also be \nlimiting. For example, too much water or fertilizer can kill land plants. If acidity levels are too high in an aquatic en-vironment, some of its organisms can be harmed.\nAn additional factor that can limit the sizes of some \npopulations is population density, the number of indi-viduals in a population found within a defined area or vol-ume. Some limiting factors, called density-dependent factors,  \nbecome more important as a population\u2019s density increases. For example, in a dense population, parasites and diseases can spread more easily, resulting in higher death rates. On the other hand, a higher population density can help sexu-ally reproducing individuals to find mates more easily in order to produce offspring. Other factors such as drought and climate change are considered density-independent, be-cause they can affect population sizes regardless of density.\nNo Population Can Grow Indefinitely: \nJ-Curves and S-Curves\nSome species have an incredible ability to increase their \nnumbers and grow exponentially (see p. 14).

Members of such \npopulations typically reproduce at an early age, have many offspring each time they reproduce, and reproduce many times, with short intervals between successive generations.\nHowever, there are always limits to population growth in \nnature. Research reveals that a rapidly growing population of any species eventually reaches some size limit imposed by limiting factors such as sunlight, water, temperature, space, or nutrients, or by exposure to predators or infec-tious diseases (Concept 5.2). The sum of all such factors in any habitat is called environmental resistance. These limiting factors largely determine any area\u2019s carrying ca-pacity: the maximum population of a given species that a particular habitat can sustain indefinitely. As a popula-tion approaches the carrying capacity of its habitat, the J-shaped curve of its exponential growth (Figure 5.11, left) is converted to an S-shaped curve of logistic growth, or growth that fluctuates around a certain level (Figure 5.11, right).\nSome populations do not make a smooth transition \nfrom exponential growth to logistic growth. Instead, they use up their resource supplies and temporarily overshoot, or exceed, the carrying capacity of their environment. In such cases, the population suffers a sharp decline, called a dieback, or population crash, unless part of the popula-tion can switch to new resources or move to an area that has more resources. Such a crash occurred when reindeer were introduced onto a small island in the Bering Sea in the early 1900s (Figure 5.12).\nDifferent Species Have Different \nReproductive Patterns\nSpecies vary in their reproductive patterns. Those that \nhave a capacity for a high rate of population increase (r) are called r-selected species. They tend to have short life spans and to have many, usually small, offspring and to give them little or no parental care or protection. They overcome typically massive losses of offspring by produc-ing so many offspring that a few will likely survive to re-produce many more offspring to keep this reproductive pattern going. Examples include algae, bacteria, and most insects.\nSuch species tend to be opportunists. They reproduce \nand disperse rapidly when conditions are favorable or when a disturbance such as a fire or clear-cutting opens up a new habitat or niche for invasion. However, once estab-lished, their populations may crash because of unfavorable changes in environmental conditions or invasion by more competitive species. This helps explain why most oppor -\ntunist species go through irregular and unstable boom-and-bust cycles in their population sizes.POPULATION CRASH\nCarrying\ncapacity\nYear1910 1920 1930 1940 1950Number of reindeer2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n0Population\ncrashesPopulationovershootscarryingcapacity\nExponential growth\nFIGURE 5.12   Exponential growth, overshoot, and population crash \nof a population of reindeer introduced onto the small Bering Sea is-\nland of St. Paul in 1910.\n\u00a9 Cengage LearningEXPONENTIAL GROWTHPopulation size\nTimeLOGISTIC GROWTHPopulation size\nTimeExponential growthCarrying capacityLimiting factorsFIGURE 5.11   Populations of \nspecies can undergo exponential growth represented by a J-shaped curve (left) when resource sup-plies are plentiful.

Most organisms have reproductive patterns between the extremes of r-selected and K-\n selected \nspecies.Such species are called K-selected species because they \ntend to do well in competitive conditions when their population size is near the carrying capacity (K) of their environment.

One such change has been a rise in populations of the orcas (killer whales) that feed on them. Sci-entists hypothesize that orcas began feeding more on southern sea otters when populations of their normal prey, sea lions and seals, began declining. Also, between 2010 and 2012, the number of southern sea otters killed or injured by sharks increased for reasons that scientists are trying to understand.\nAnother factor may be parasites \nknown to breed in the intestines of cats. Scientists hypothesize that some southern sea otters might be dying be-cause coastal area cat owners flush feces-laden cat litter down their toilets or dump it in storm drains that empty into coastal waters. The feces contain parasites that then infect the otters.\nOtters are also threatened by \nblooms of toxic algae that are fed by urea, a key ingredient in fertilizer that washes into coastal waters. Other pol-lutants released by human activities are PCBs and other fat-soluble toxic chemi-cals that can kill otters by accumulating to high levels in the tissues of the shellfish on which otters feed. Because southern sea otters feed at high trophic levels and live close to the shore, they are vulnerable to these and other pollutants in coastal waters.\nThe factors listed here, mostly re-\nsulting from human activities, plus a fairly low reproductive rate and a rising mortality rate, have hindered the ability of the endangered southern sea otter to rebuild its population (Figure 5.B). In 2012, the National Geographic Society funded a project led by Nicole Thometz to learn more about why juvenile sea otters, in particular, were suffering a high mortality rate. The aim of this study was to track changes in the physiological development of the otters and to understand how physiological WHY DO CALIFORNIA\u2019S SOUTHERN SEA OTTERS FACE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE?\nvariables affected their foraging ability and success. Such information could be used to help biologists to refine recov-ery plans for the southern sea otter. According to the U.S. Geological Sur -\nvey, the California southern sea otter population would have to reach at least 3,090 animals for 3 years in a row before it could be considered for removal from the endangered species list.\nCritical Thinking\nhow would you design a controlled ex-\nperiment to test the hypothesis that cat litter flushed down toilets might be killing southern sea otters?ScienceFocus5.2\nSOUTHERN SEA OTTER POPULATION\nYearDelisting threshold (3,090)Sea otter population estimate\n1985 2005 2000 2010 1990 1995", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3846, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67d873e1-5251-459c-8c88-1fa8712fe453": {"__data__": {"id_": "67d873e1-5251-459c-8c88-1fa8712fe453", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "G.

In 1845, \nIreland experienced such a crash after a fungus destroyed its potato crop. About 1 million people died from hunger or diseases related to malnutrition, and millions more mi-grated to other countries, sharply reducing the Irish population.\nDuring the 14th century, the plague spread through \ndensely populated European cities and killed at least 25 million people, amounting to one-third of the European population. The bacterium causing this disease normally lives in rodents. It was transferred to humans by fleas that fed on infected rodents and then bit humans. The disease spread like wildfire through crowded cities, where sanitary conditions were poor and rats were abundant. Today sev-eral antibiotics can be used to treat bubonic plague.\nSo far, technological, social, and other cultural changes \nhave expanded the earth\u2019s carrying capacity for the hu-man species. We have used large amounts of energy and matter resources to occupy formerly uninhabitable areas, to expand agriculture, and to control the populations of other species that compete with us for resources. Some say we can keep expanding our ecological footprint in this way indefinitely, mostly because of our technological inge-nuity. Others say that sooner or later, we will reach the limits that nature eventually imposes on any population that exceeds or degrades its resource base.

This can be illustrated by a survivorship curve, which shows the percentages of the members of a popula-tion surviving at different ages. There are three general-ized types of survivorship curves: late loss, early loss, and constant loss (Figure 5.13). A late loss population (such as elephants and rhinoceroses) typically has high survivor -\nship to a certain age, then high mortality. A constant loss population (such as many songbirds) shows a fairly con-stant death rate at all ages. For an early loss population (such as annual plants and many bony fish species), survi-vorship is low early in life. These generalized survivorship curves only approximate the realities of nature.\n90446_ch05_082-099.indd   96 8/13/14   8:27 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Define pop-ulation. Why do most populations live in clumps? \nOn the western coast  of North America, \nsea otters are part of a complex ecosystem made up of large \nunderwater kelp forests, bottom-dwelling creatures, whales, and other species that depend on one another for survival.The sea otters act as keystone species mostly by feeding on sea urchins and keeping them from destroying the kelp. \n however, the kelp forests are potentially in danger because \nsea otter populations have been vulnerable to a combination of \n overhunting for their pelts, predation by other species, and \nexposure to harmful chemicals and parasites introduced into ocean waters by human activities.\nIn this chapter, we focused on how biodiversity promotes \nsustainability, provides a variety of species to restore damaged ecosystems through ecological succession, and limits the sizes of populations. Populations of most plants and animals de-pend, directly or indirectly, on solar energy, and all popula-tions play roles in the cycling of nutrients in the ecosystems where they live. In addition, the biodiversity found in the vari-ety of species in different terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems provides alternative paths for energy flow and nutrient  cycling, better opportunities for natural selection as environ-mental conditions change, and natural population control mechanisms. When we disrupt these paths, we violate  \nall three scientific principles of sustainability.TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nSouthern Sea Otters and Sustainability\nfred goldstein/shutterstock.com\n90446_ch05_082-099.indd   97 8/13/14   8:27 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

There might be 8.1 billion of us by 2025, 9.7 bil-lion by 2050, and perhaps 11 billion by 2100.\nThe subject of population is not \njust about the number of people. It is also about how the world\u2019s people are distributed among rural and urban areas. More than half (52%) of the world\u2019s people live in urban areas and by 2050, two of every three people are likely to be urban dwellers\u2014most of them in rapidly growing cities in less-developed countries (see chapter-opening photo). Most of the world\u2019s urban areas have huge ecological footprints that extend far beyond their boundaries, and they are not self-sustaining systems. Four of the biggest challenges of this century are to find ways to slow population growth, to reduce our ecological footprints (see Figure 1.10, p. 12), to increase our beneficial environmental impact, and to make rapidly growing urban areas more sustainable and livable.\nPortland, Oregon, a city that lies \non the banks of the Willamette River (Figure 6.1), is leading the way in meeting at least three of those chal-lenges. It has consistently ranked at  \nor near the top in several lists of the most sustainable and livable U.S. cities for over four decades.\nSince the 1970s, Portland has used \nstrong land-use policies to control its growth, reduce dependence on auto-mobiles, and preserve green space. Portland encourages the development of mixed-use neighborhoods with stores, light industries, professional offices, high-density housing, and access to mass transit, which allows most people to meet most of their daily needs without using a car. The city has excellent light-rail and bus lines, and has further reduced car use by developing an extensive network  \nof bike lanes and walkways. This decreased reliance on the automobile has saved its residents more than $1 billion a year in transportation costs. It has also contributed to public health by cutting air pollution and encourag-ing higher levels of physical activity.\nPortland implemented a recycling \nsystem in 1987 and, by 2013, was recycling and composting 67% of its municipal solid waste\u2014one of the highest rates in the country. In 1993, Portland became the first U.S. city to develop a plan to reduce its green-house gas emissions. By 2012, it had reduced its per capita greenhouse gas emissions to 26% below 1990 levels\u2014more than any other major U.S. city had done. In 2009, Portland imple-mented a Climate Action Plan with the goal of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and to 80% below those  \nlevels by 2050.\nIn this chapter, we examine popu-\nlation growth trends and the environ-mental impacts of our growing population, and we look at ways to slow population growth and to make the world\u2019s rapidly growing urban areas more sustainable and livable.\nPortland, Oregon: On a Quest for Urban Sustainability\n102 \nJit Lim/cutcaster\nFIGURE 6.1   Portland, Oregon is one of the most environmentally friendly and sustainable cities in \nthe United States.\n90446_ch06_100-127.indd   102 8/13/14   8:31 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

But for the past 200 years, the human population has grown rapidly, re-sulting in the characteristic J-curve of exponential growth (Figure 1.12, right part of curve).\nThree major factors account for this rapid rise of the hu-\nman population: early and modern agriculture allowed us to feed more people; technologies helped us expand into al-most all of the planet\u2019s climate zones and habitats (see Figure 1.10, p. 12); and death rates dropped sharply because of improved sanitation and health care and the development of antibiotics and vaccines to help control infectious diseases.\nDemographers, or population experts, recognize three \nimportant trends related to the current size and impact of the human population. First, the rate of population growth \nhas slowed since 1960 (Figure 6.2), but the world\u2019s popu-lation is still growing at a rate of about 1.2%. This may not seem like much but in 2013, this growth added about 85 million people to the population\u2014an average of about 162 people every minute.\nSecond, human population growth is unevenly distrib-\nuted. About 96% of the 85 million new arrivals on the planet in 2013 were added to the world\u2019s less-developed countries, where the population is growing 14 times faster than the population of the more-developed countries. At least 95% of the 2.6 billion people projected to be added to the world\u2019s population between 2013 and 2050 will live in less-developed countries, most of which are not equipped to deal with the pressures of such rapid growth.\nThird, people have moved in large numbers from rural \nareas to urban areas. About 52% of world\u2019s people now live in urban areas and this trend is increasing.\nScientists and other analysts have long pondered the \nquestion: How long can the human population continue to grow while sidestepping many of the factors that sooner or later limit the growth of any population? These experts disagree over how many people the earth can support in-definitely (Science Focus 6.1). So far, advances in food production and health care have staved off widespread population declines. But there is extensive and growing evidence that we are depleting and degrading much of the earth\u2019s irreplaceable natural capital (Figure 6.3) and that we are approaching or exceeding various planetary bound-aries (see Figure 3.A, p. 58).\nFIGURE 6.2   Global human population growth rate, 1950\u20132013, with projection to 2050 (in blue). \nQuestion: Why do you think that while the annual growth rate of world population has generally \ndropped since the 1960s, the population has continued to grow?

If \nthere are more births than deaths during a given period of time, the human population increases, and when the op-posite is true, it decreases.\nHuman populations grow or decline in particular coun-\ntries, cities, or other areas through the interplay of three factors: births (fertility), deaths (mortality), and migration. We \ncan calculate the population change of an area by sub-tracting the number of people leaving a population (through death and emigration) from the number entering it (through birth and immigration) during a specified pe-riod of time (usually 1 year) (Concept 6.2A).\nPopulation = (Births +  Immigration) \u2212  (Deaths +  Emigration)change\nAre there physical limits to human \npopulation growth and economic \ngrowth on a finite planet? Some say yes. Others say no.\nThe debate over possible limits to \nthe growth of human populations and economies has been going on for more than 200 years. Meanwhile, natural capital degradation (Figure 6.2) has oc-curred widely and grown more intense. The earth\u2019s life-support system has been resilient enough to withstand such widespread disturbances. However, at some point, we could reach one or more planetary boundar -\nies or ecological tipping points (see Fig-ure 3.A, p. 58). Exceeding such boundaries could lead to damaging long-term changes and the possibility of a sharp decline in the human popu-lation due to increasing death rates.\nTo some analysts, the key problem is \nthe large and rapidly growing number of people in less-developed countries (see Table 1.1, p. 13). To others, the key factor is overconsumption in afflu- HOW LONG CAN THE HUMAN POPULATION KEEP GROWING?\nent, more-developed countries because of their high rates of resource use per person. Thus, they debate over which is more important for shrinking the hu-man ecological footprint: slowing pop-ulation growth or reducing resource consumption. Some call for doing both.\nAnother view of population growth \nis that, so far, technological advances have allowed us to overcome the envi-ronmental limits that all populations of other species face and that this has had the effect of increasing the earth\u2019s ScienceFocus6.1\nReducing biodiversity\nIncreasing use of net  \nprimary productivity\nIncreasing genetic resistance in pest \nspecies and disease-causing bacteria\nEliminating many natural predatorsIntroducing harmful species into \nnatural communities\nUsing some renewable resources \nfaster than they can be replenished\nDisrupting natural chemical cycling \nand energy /f_low\nRelying mostly on polluting and \nclimate-changing fossil fuelsAltering Nature to Meet Our Needs\nNatural Capital Degradation\nFIGURE 6.3   Human activities have altered the natural systems and \necosystem services that sustain our lives and economies in at least \neight major ways to meet the increasing needs and wants of our growing population (Concept 6.1).

S44 in Supplement 5 for more detailed population-related data for high-, middle-, and low-income countries.\nWomen Are Having Fewer Babies but the \nWorld\u2019s Population Is Still Growing\nA key factor affecting human population growth and size \nis the total fertility rate (TFR): the average number of children born to the women in a population during their reproductive years (Concept 6.2B). See the Case Study that follows and see Figure 12, p. S29, in Supplement 4 for a map showing how TFRs vary globally.\nBetween 1955 and 2013, the global TFR dropped from \n5 to 2.5. Those who support slowing the world\u2019s popula-tion growth view this as good news. However, to eventu-ally halt population growth, the global TFR would have to drop to 2.1\u2014the rate necessary for replacing both parents after taking infant mortality into account.\nCASE STUDY\nThe U.S. Population\u2014Third Largest  \nand Growing\nThe United States has the world\u2019s third largest population. \nBetween 1900 and 2013, its population grew fourfold from 76 million to 316 million, despite oscillations in the country\u2019s TFR (Figure 6.4) and population growth rate. During the period of high birth rates between 1946 and 1964, known as the baby boom, 79 million people were added to the U.S. population. At the peak of the baby boom in 1957, the average TFR was 3.7 children per woman. In most years since 1972, it has been at or below 2.1 children per woman, compared to a global TFR of 2.5.\nThe drop in the TFR has slowed the rate of population \ngrowth in the United States, but the country\u2019s population is still growing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 2.7 million people were added to the U.S. popula-tion in 2013. About 1.6 million (59% of the total) were added because there were that many more births than deaths, and about 1.1 million (41% of the total) were legal immigrants. Since 1820 the United States has admitted almost twice as many legal immigrants and refugees as all other countries combined. In 2013, the country also had about 11.5 million illegal immigrants.\nIn addition to the fourfold increase in population \ngrowth since 1900, some amazing changes in lifestyles took place in the United States during the 20th century (Figure 6.5), which led to Americans living longer. Along with this came dramatic increases in per capita resource use and much larger total and per capita ecological footprints.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau projected that between 2013 \nand 2050, the U.S. population would likely grow from 316 million to 400 million\u2014an increase of 84 million people. The United States has the world\u2019s largest total and per capita ecological footprints, mostly because of its very high \ncarrying capacity for our species. Pro-\nponents of this view point out that av-erage life expectancy in most of the world has been steadily rising, despite warnings that we are seriously degrad-ing our life-support system.\nSome of these analysts argue that \nbecause of our technological ingenuity, there are few, if any, limits to human population growth and resource use per person. They believe that we can continue ever-increasing economic growth and avoid serious damage to our life-support systems by making technological advances in areas such as food production and medicine, and by finding substitutes for resources that we are depleting. As a result, they see no need to slow population growth or resource consumption.\nProponents of slowing and eventu-\nally stopping population growth point out that in addition to degrading our life-support system, we are failing to provide the basic necessities for about 1.4 billion people\u2014one of every five on the planet\u2014who struggle to survive", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3962, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "980ad835-57e6-40a7-bd98-d92dc8c51d6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "980ad835-57e6-40a7-bd98-d92dc8c51d6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "G.

Many poor couples in those countries struggling to survive on less than $2.25 a day have a large number of children to help haul daily drinking water, gather wood for heating and cooking, and grow or find food. Many children in such countries have to work for wages to help their families survive (Figure 6.6).\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Poverty and Population Growth in \nAfrica\nWith a TFR of 4.8, Africa\u2019s population is growing faster than that of any conti-\nnent and is projected to grow from 1.1 billion to 2.4 billion between 2013 and 2050. Africa is also the world\u2019s poorest continent.\nAnother economic factor is the cost of raising and educat-\ning children. Birth and fertility rates tend to be lower in \nmore-developed countries, where raising children is much more costly because they do not enter the labor force until they are in their late teens or twenties. In the United States, the cost of raising a child born in 2013 to age 18 will range from $169,000 to $390,000 depending on household income.\nThe availability of, or lack of, private and public pension \nsystems can influence the number of children some couples have, especially the poor in less-developed countries.

People living in urban \nareas usually have better access to family planning services and tend to have fewer children than do those living in the rural areas of poorer countries.\nAnother important factor is the educational and employ-\nment opportunities available for women. Total fertility rates tend to be low when women have access to education and paid employment outside the home. In less-developed countries, a woman with no education typically has two more children than does a woman with a high school education.\nAverage age at marriage (or, more precisely, the average \nage at which a woman has her first child) also plays a role. Women normally have fewer children when their average age at marriage is 25 or older.\nBirth rates and TFRs are also affected by the availability \nof legal abortions. According to the World Health Organiza-tion and the Guttmacher Institute, each year, more than 208 million women become pregnant and at least 40 million of them get abortions\u2014about 20 million of them legal and the other 20 million illegal (and often unsafe). The avail-ability of reliable birth control methods also allows women to control the number and spacing of the children they have.\nReligious beliefs, traditions, and cultural norms also play a \nrole. In some countries, these factors favor large families, as many people strongly oppose abortion and some forms of birth control.\nSeveral Factors Affect Death Rates\nThe rapid growth of the world\u2019s population over the past 100 years is not primarily the result of a rise in the birth rate. Instead, it is largely the result of declining death rates, especially in less-developed countries. More people in some of these countries are living longer and fewer infants are dying because of larger food supplies, improvements in food distribution, better nutrition, medical advances such as immunizations and antibiotics, improved sanitation, and safer water supplies.\nA useful indicator of the overall health of people in a \ncountry or region is life expectancy: the average number of years a person born in the year of the estimate can be expected to live. Between 1955 and 2013, the average global life expectancy increased from 48 years to 70 years. In 2013, Japan had the world\u2019s longest life expectancy of 83 years. Between 1900 and 2013, the average U.S. life expectancy rose from 47 years to 79 years. In the world\u2019s poorest countries, life expectancy in 2013 was 55 years or less. Research indicates that poverty, which reduces the average life span by 7\u201310 years, is the single most impor -\ntant factor affecting life expectancy.\nAnother important indicator of overall health in a \npopulation is its infant mortality rate, the number of babies out of every 1,000 born who die before their first birthday. It is viewed as one of the best measures of a so-ciety\u2019s quality of life because it reflects a country\u2019s general level of nutrition and health care. (See Figure 13, p. S29, in Supplement 4 for a map comparing generalized infant mortality rates among the world\u2019s countries.)\n A high in-\nfant mortality rate usually indicates insufficient food (un-dernutrition), poor nutrition (malnutrition, see Figure 1.13, p. 16), and a high incidence of infectious disease. Infant mortality also affects the TFR.

Even so, every year more than 4 million infants (most of them in less-developed countries) die of preventable causes during their first year of life. This average of nearly 11,000 mostly unnecessary infant deaths per day is equivalent to 55 jet airliners, each loaded with 200 infants, crashing every day with no survivors\u2014an on-going tragedy rarely reported in the media.\nBetween 1900 and 2013, the U.S. infant mortality rate \ndropped from 165 to 5.9. This sharp decline was a major factor in the marked increase in U.S. average life expec-tancy during this period. However, 40 other nations (most in Europe) had lower infant mortality rates than the United States in 2013.\nMigration Affects an Area\u2019s  \nPopulation Size\nA third factor in population change is migration: the \nmovement of people into (immigration) and out of (emigra-tion) specific geographic areas. Most people migrate to an-other area within their country or to another country to seek jobs and economic improvement. But many are driven to migrate by religious persecution, ethnic conflicts, political oppression, or war. There are also environmental refugees\u2014people who have to leave their homes and some-times their countries because of water or food shortages, soil erosion, or some other form of environmental degra-dation or depletion.6.3 HOW DOES A POPULATION\u2019S \nAGE STRUCTURE AFFECT ITS GROWTH OR DECLINE?\nCONCEPT 6.3   The numbers of males and females in \nyoung, middle, and older age groups determine how fast a \npopulation grows or declines.\nA Population\u2019s Age Structure Helps Us to \nMake Projections\nAn important factor determining whether the population of a \ncountry increases or decreases is its age structure: the num-\nbers or percentages of males and females in young, middle, and older age groups in that population (Concept 6.3).\nPopulation experts construct a population age-structure \ndiagram by plotting the percentages or numbers of males and females in the total population in each of three age categories: prereproductive (ages 0\u201314), consisting of indi-\nviduals normally too young to have children; reproductive (ages 15\u201344), consisting of those normally able to have children; and postreproductive (ages 45 and older), with in-dividuals normally too old to have children. Figure 6.7 presents generalized age-structure diagrams for countries with rapid, slow, zero, and negative population growth rates.\nA country with a large percentage of its people younger \nthan age 15 (represented by a wide base in Figure 6.7, far left) will experience rapid population growth unless death rates rise sharply.

Most future human population growth will take place in less-developed coun-tries because of their typically youthful age structure and rapid population growth rates.\nThe global population of seniors\u2014people who are 65 \nand older\u2014is projected to triple between 2013 and 2050, when one of every six people will be a senior. This graying of the world\u2019s population is due largely to declining birth rates and medical advances that have extended life spans. In 2013, the three nations with the largest senior popula-tions (by percentage of their total population) were Japan (25%), Germany (21%), and Italy (21%). In such coun-tries, the number of working adults is shrinking in propor -\ntion to the number of seniors, which in turn is slowing the growth of tax revenues in these countries. This raises ques-tions about how such societies will support their growing populations of seniors.\nCASE STUDY\nThe American Baby Boom\nChanges in the distribution of a country\u2019s age groups have long-lasting economic and social impacts. For example, consider the American baby boom, which added 79 million people to the U.S. population between 1946 and 1964. Over time, this group looks like a bulge moving up through the country\u2019s age structure, as shown in Figure 6.8.\nFor decades, members of the baby-boom generation \nhave strongly influenced the U.S. economy because they make up about 36% of all adult Americans. Baby boomers created the youth market in their teens and twenties and are now creating the late-middle-age and senior markets. In addition to having this economic impact, the baby-boom generation plays an increasingly important role in deciding who gets elected to public office and what laws are passed or weakened.\nSince 2011, when the first baby boomers began turn-\ning 65, the number of Americans older than age 65 has grown at the rate of about 10,000 a day and will do so through 2030. This process has been called the graying of America. As the number of working adults declines in pro-portion to the number of seniors, there may be political pressure from baby boomers to increase tax revenues to help support the growing senior population. This could lead to economic and political conflicts between older and younger Americans.\nAging Populations Can Decline Rapidly\nAs the percentage of people age 65 or older increases, more countries will begin experiencing population de-clines. If population decline is gradual, its harmful effects usually can be managed. However, some countries are experiencing fairly rapid declines and feeling such effects more severely.\nJapan has the world\u2019s highest percentage of elderly \npeople (above age 65) and the world\u2019s lowest percentage of young people (below age 15). In 2013, Japan\u2019s popula-tion was 127 million. By 2050, its population is projected to be 97 million, a 24% drop. As its population declines, there will be fewer adults working and paying taxes to support an increasing elderly population. Because Japan discourages immigration, this could threaten its economic future.\n102030507080+\n0\n1955Age\nFemales Males\n1020304050607080+\n0\n1985Age\nFemales Males\n1020304050607080+\n0\n2015Age\nFemales Males\n1020304050607080+\n0\n2035Age\nFemales Males\n2016128484121620\n201612848412162024\n2460\n4060\nMillions\n201612848412162024\n24Millions\n201612848412162024\n24Millions Millions\nANIMATED FIGURE 6.8   Age structure charts tracking the baby-boom generation in the United \nStates, 1955, 1985, 2015, and 2035 (projected).\nCompiled by the authors using data from U.S. Census Bureau and Population Reference", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3773, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74f164e8-cc40-4ad7-bcf1-7999dd06afc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "74f164e8-cc40-4ad7-bcf1-7999dd06afc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "G.

Countries with rapidly declining \npopulations, in addition to Japan, include Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia, Greece, and Portugal. Other countries facing population declines in the not-too-distant future are Thailand (with a TFR drop from 7.0 in the 1970s to 1.6 in 2013) and South Korea (with a TFR of 1.3). Population declines are very difficult to reverse.\n6.4 WHAT ARE SOME WAYS TO \nSLOW HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH?\nCONCEPT 6.4   We can slow human population growth by \nreducing poverty through economic development, elevating \nthe status of women, and encouraging family planning.\nPromoting Economic Development Can \nStabilize a Population\nThere is controversy over whether we should slow popu-\nlation growth (Science Focus 6.1). Many analysts have argued that, because population growth can be linked to environmental degradation, we need to slow population growth in order to reduce such degradation. These experts have suggested several ways to do this, one of which is to reduce poverty through economic development.\nDemographers, examining the birth and \ndeath rates of western European countries that became industrialized during the 19th century, have developed a hypothesis on population change known as the demo-graphic transition: As countries become industrialized and economically developed, their per capita incomes rise, poverty de-clines, and their populations tend to grow more slowly. According to the hypothesis, this transition takes place in four stages, as shown in Figure 6.10.\nSome analysts believe that most of the \nworld\u2019s less-developed countries will make a demographic transition over the next few de-cades, primarily because newer technologies will help them to develop economically and to reduce poverty by raising their per capita incomes. Other analysts fear that rapid popu-lation growth, extreme poverty, and increas-ing environmental degradation and resource depletion could leave some low-income, less-developed countries stuck in stage 2 of the demographic transition. This highlights the \nneed to reduce poverty as a key to improving human health and stabilizing the population.\nEmpowerment of Women Tends to Slow \nPopulation Growth\nA number of studies show that women tend to have fewer \nchildren if they are educated, have the ability to control their own fertility, earn an income of their own, and live in societies that do not suppress their rights. Although women make up roughly half of the world\u2019s population, in most societies, they have fewer rights and educational and economic opportunities than men have.\nWomen do almost all of the world\u2019s domestic work and \nchild care for little or no pay and provide more unpaid health care (within their families) than do all of the world\u2019s organized health-care services combined. In rural areas of Africa, Latin America, and Asia, women do 60\u201380% of the work associated with growing food, hauling water, and gathering, and hauling wood (Figure 6.11) and animal dung for use as fuel. As one Brazilian woman ob-served, \u201cFor poor women, the only holiday is when you are asleep.\u201d\nWhile women account for 66% of all hours worked, \nthey receive only 10% of the world\u2019s income and own just 2% of the world\u2019s land. They also make up 70% of the world\u2019s poor and 66% of its 800 million illiterate adults.

As it expands, such bottom-up change driven by individual women will play an important role in stabilizing populations, improving human health, reducing poverty and environmental degradation, and allowing more access to basic human rights.\nSome Argue for Promoting Family Planning\nFamily planning involves the provision of education and clinical services that can help couples to choose how many children to have and when to have them. Such programs vary from culture to culture, but most of them provide information on birth spacing, birth control, and health care for pregnant women and infants.\nFamily planning enables women to limit the size of \ntheir families if they wish to do so, and to plan their preg-nancies. According to studies by the UN Population Divi-sion and other population agencies, family planning has been a major factor in reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and births, the number of safe and unsafe abortions, the number of mothers and fetuses dying dur -\ning pregnancy, rates of infant mortality, rates of HIV/AIDS infection, and population growth rates. It also has financial benefits. Studies have shown that each dollar spent on family planning in countries such as Thailand, Egypt, and Bangladesh saves $10\u2013$16 in health, education, and social service costs by preventing unwanted births.01020304050607080\nLow Increasing Very high Decreasing Low Zero NegativeGrowth rate over timeBirth rate and death rate\n(number per 1,000 per year)Stage 1\nPreindustrialStage 2\nTransitionalStage 3\nIndustrialStage 4\nPostindustrial\nPopulation grows rapidly because birth\nrates are high and death rates drop becauseof improved food production and healthPopulationgrowth slowsas both birthand deathrates dropbecause ofimproved foodproduction,health, andeducationPopulation growth levelsoff and then declines asbirth rates equal and thenfall below death rates\nBirth rateTotal population\nDeath ratePopulationgrows veryslowly becauseof a highbirth rate(to compensatefor high infantmortality) and ahigh death rate\nANIMATED FIGURE 6.10   The demographic transition, which a country can experience as it be-\ncomes industrialized and more economically developed, can take place in four stages.

The world\u2019s first na-tional family planning program began in India in 1952, when its population was nearly 400 million. In 2013, after 61 years of population control efforts, India had 1.28 bil-lion people\u2014the world\u2019s second largest population and a TFR of 2.4. Much of this increase occurred because the country\u2019s declining death rates.\nIn 1952, India added 5 million people to its population. \nIn 2013, it added 19 million\u2014more than any other coun-try. The United Nations projects that by 2030, India will be the world\u2019s most populous country, and that by 2050, it will have a population of 1.65 billion.\nIndia has the world\u2019s fourth largest economy and a \nrapidly growing middle class of more than 100 million people\u2014a number nearly equal to a third of the U.S. population. However, the country faces serious poverty, malnutrition, and environmental problems that could worsen as its population continues to grow rapidly. About one-fourth of all people in India\u2019s cities live in slums, and prosperity and progress have not touched hundreds of millions of Indians who live in rural villages. With 400 million people earning less than $1.25 per day, India is home to one-third of the world\u2019s poor (Figure 6.12). Nearly half of the country\u2019s labor force is unemployed or underemployed.\nTwo factors help to account for larger families in India. \nFirst, most poor couples believe they need several children to work and care for them in their old age. Second, the strong cultural preference in India for male children means that some couples keep having children until they produce one or more boys. The result: even though 90% of Indian couples have access to at least one modern birth control method, only about 47% actually use one.\nIndia is undergoing rapid economic growth, which is \nexpected to accelerate over the next few decades. This will help many people in India, but it will also put increasing pressure on the country\u2019s and the earth\u2019s natural capital as rates of per capita resource use rise. India already faces serious soil erosion, overgrazing, water pollution, and air pollution problems. On the other hand, economic growth may help India to slow its population growth by accelerat-ing its demographic transition.\nFIGURE 6.12   Homeless people in Kolkata, India in 2011.\nSamrat35 | Dreamstime.com\n90446_ch06_100-127.indd   112 8/13/14   8:31 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that if current trends continue, China\u2019s population is expected to decline to about 1.3 billion by 2050 and to as low as 750 million by the end of this century.\nIn the 1960s, China\u2019s large population was growing so \nrapidly that there was a serious threat of mass starvation. To avoid this, government officials took measures that eventually led to the establishment of the world\u2019s most extensive, intru-sive, and strict family planning and birth control program.\nThe goal has been to sharply reduce population growth \nand avoid mass starvation and social upheaval by promot-ing one-child families. The government provides contra-ceptives, sterilizations, and abortions for married couples. In addition, married couples pledging to have no more than one child receive a number of benefits, including bet-ter housing, more food, free health care, salary bonuses, and preferential job opportunities for their child. Couples who break their pledge lose such benefits.\nSince this government-controlled program began, \nChina has made impressive efforts to feed its people and bring its population growth under control. Between 1972 and 2013, the country cut its birth rate in half and reduced its TFR from 5.7 to 1.5 (compared to 1.9 in 2013 in the United States and 2.4 in India). China\u2019s population is growing more slowly than the U.S. population, even with legal immigration included. Although China has avoided mass starvation, its strict population control program has been accused of violating human rights.\nSince 1980, China has undergone rapid industrializa-\ntion and economic growth. According to the Earth Policy Institute, between 1990 and 2010, this process reduced the number of people living in extreme poverty by almost 500 million. It has also helped at least 300 million Chinese\u2014 a number almost equal to the entire U.S. population\u2014to become middle-class consumers. Over time, China\u2019s rapidly growing middle class will consume more resources per per -\nson, expanding China\u2019s ecological footprint within its own borders and in other parts of the world that provide it with resources. This will put a strain on China\u2019s and the earth\u2019s natural capital. Like India, China faces serious soil erosion, overgrazing, water pollution, and air pollution problems.\nBecause of its one-child policy, during the past two \ndecades, the average age of China\u2019s population has been increasing at one of the fastest rates ever recorded.

While China\u2019s population is not yet declining, the UN estimates that by 2030, the country is likely to have too few young workers to support its rapidly aging population. This graying of the Chinese population could lead to a declining work force, limited funds for sup-porting continued economic development, and fewer chil-dren and grandchildren to care for the growing number of elderly people. These concerns and other factors may slow China\u2019s economic growth and lead to some relaxation of the country\u2019s one-child population control policy.\n6.5 WHAT ARE THE MAJOR  \nURBAN RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS?\nCONCEPT 6.5   Most cities are unsustainable because of \nhigh levels of resource use, waste, pollution, and poverty.\nPopulation Experts See Three Important \nUrban Trends\nAbout 52% of the world\u2019s people, 81% of all Americans \n(see Case Study that follows), and 53% of China\u2019s popula-tion live in urban areas. Every day there are about 200,000 more urban dwellers. See Figure 10, p. S26 in Supplement 4 for a map of global population density.\nUrban areas grow in two ways\u2014by natural increase \n(more births than deaths) and by immigration, mostly from rural areas. Rural people are pulled to urban areas in search of jobs, food, housing, educational opportunities, better health care, and entertainment. Some are also pushed from rural to urban areas by factors such as famine, losses of land for growing food, deteriorating environmental condi-tions, war, and religious, racial, and political conflicts.\nThree major trends in urban population dynamics are \nimportant for understanding the problems and challenges of urban growth:\n1.\n The percentage of the global population that lives in urban \nareas has grown sharply and this trend is projected to continue. Between 1850 and 2013, the percentage of the world\u2019s people living in urban areas increased from 2% to 52% and is likely to reach 67% by 2050, with most new urban dwellers living in less-developed countries.\n2.\n The numbers and sizes of urban areas are mushrooming.  \nToday there are 26 megacities\u2014cities with 10 million or more people\u201419 of them in less-developed countries (Figure 6.14). Nine of these urban areas are hypercities  \nwith more than 20 million people. The largest hypercity is Tokyo, Japan with 37.1 million\u2014more than the entire population of Canada. By 2025, the number of megacities is expected to reach 37 with 21 \nFIGURE 6.14   Global outlook: Megacities, or major urban areas with 10 million or more people, in \n2012.

Some of the world\u2019s megacities and \nhypercities are merging into vast urban megaregions,  \neach with more than 100 million people. The largest megaregion is the Hong Kong-Shenhzen-Guangzhou region in China with about 120 million people.\n3.\n Poverty is becoming increasingly urbanized, mostly in less-developed countries. The United Nations estimates that at least 1 billion people live in the slums and shantytowns of most of the major cities in less-  \ndeveloped countries (see chapter-opening photo).\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Urban Trends\nif you could reverse one of the three urban trends discussed here, which one \nwould it be? explain.\nCASE STUDY\nUrbanization in the United States\nBetween 1800 and 2013, the percentage of the U.S. popu-lation living in urban areas increased from 5% to 81%. This population shift has occurred in three phases.\nFirst, people migrated from rural areas to large central cities. \nIn 2013, about 71% of all Americans lived in urban areas with at least 50,000 people, and about 54% lived in urban areas with 1 million or more residents (Figure 6.15, shaded areas).\nSecond, many people migrated from large central cities to \nsmaller cities and suburbs. Currently, about half of all urban Americans live in the suburbs, nearly a third in central cities, and the rest in rural housing developments beyond suburbs.Third, many people migrated from the North and East to the \nSouth and West. Since 1980, about 80% of the U.S. popula-tion increase, occurred in the South and West.\nSince 1920, and especially since 1970, many of the \nworst urban environmental problems in the United States have been reduced significantly (Figure 6.5). Most people have better working and housing conditions and air and water quality have improved. Better sanita-tion, clean public water supplies, and expanded medical care have slashed death rates and incidences of sickness from infectious diseases. Also, the concentration of most of the population in urban areas has helped to protect some of the country\u2019s biodiversity by reducing the destruction and degradation of wildlife habitat.\nHowever, a number of U.S. central cities\u2014especially \nolder ones\u2014have deteriorating services and aging infra-structures (streets, bridges, dams, power lines, schools, wa-ter supply pipes, and sewers). Funds for repairing and upgrading urban infrastructure have declined in many ur -\nban areas as the flight of people and businesses to the sub-urbs and beyond has led to lower central city property tax revenues. However, this trend, too, has been reversed in some cities, including Portland, Oregon (Core Case Study).\nUrban Sprawl Gobbles Up the Countryside\nIn the United States and some other countries, urban sprawl\u2014the growth of low-density development on the edges of cities and towns\u2014is eliminating agricultural and wild lands around many cities (Figure 6.16). It results in a dispersed jumble of housing developments, shopping malls, parking lots, and office complexes that are loosely connected by multilane highways and freeways.GOOD\nNEWS\nFIGURE 6.15   Urbanized areas \n(shaded) in the United States \nwhere cities, suburbs, and  \ntowns dominate the land area.  \nQuestion: Why do you think many of the largest urban areas are located near water?\nCompiled by the authors using data from National \nGeophysical Data Center/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S. Census Bureau.\n90446_ch06_100-127.indd   115 8/13/14   8:31 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Would you prefer to live in a central city, a suburb, or an exurb? explain.\nUrbanization Has Advantages\nUrbanization has many benefits. From an economic \nstandpoint, cities are centers of economic develop-ment, innovation, education, technological advances, so-cial and cultural diversity, and job markets. Urban residents in many parts of the world tend to live longer than do rural residents and to have lower infant mortality and fer -\ntility rates. They typically also have better access to medi-cal care, family planning, education, and social services than do their rural counterparts.\nUrban areas also have some environmental advan-\ntages. Recycling is more economically feasible because of the high concentrations of recyclable materials in urban areas. Concentrating people in cities helps to preserve bio-diversity by reducing the stress on wildlife habitats. Heat-ing and cooling multistory apartment and office buildings in central cities takes less energy per person than does heating and cooling single-family homes and smaller office buildings, more common in the suburbs. Central-city dwellers also tend to drive less and rely more on mass transportation, car-pooling, walking, and bicycling.\nUrbanization Has Disadvantages\nMost urban areas are unsustainable systems. Urban pop-ulations occupy only about 3% of the earth\u2019s land area, but they consume about 75% of its resources and pro-duce about 75% of the world\u2019s pollution and wastes. Because of this high input of food, water, and other re-sources, and the resulting high waste output (Figure 6.18), most of the world\u2019s cities have huge ecological footprints that extend far beyond their boundaries, and GOOD\nNEWSthey typically are not self-sustaining systems (Concept \n6.5), for a number of reasons.\nMost Cities Lack Vegetation. In urban areas, most \ntrees, shrubs, grasses, and other plants are cleared to make way for buildings, roads, parking lots, and housing devel-opments. Thus, most cities do not benefit from the free ecosystem services provided by vegetation, including air purification, generation of oxygen, removal of atmo-spheric CO\n2, control of soil erosion, and the provision of \nhabitat for wildlife.\nMany Cities Have Water Problems. Often, as cities \ngrow and their water demands increase, expensive reser -\nvoirs and canals must be built and deeper wells must be drilled. This can deprive rural and wild areas of surface water and it can deplete groundwater supplies. Also, pro-jected climate change is expected to melt some moun-taintop glaciers, and cities that depend on this ice for much of their annual water supplies will face severe water shortages.\nFlooding also tends to be greater in cities that are built \non floodplains near rivers or along low-lying coastlines. In most cities, buildings and paved surfaces cause precipita-tion to run off quickly and overload storm drains. Urban development has often destroyed or degraded large areas of wetlands that have served as natural sponges to help absorb excess storm water. Many of the world\u2019s largest coastal cities (Figure 6.14) will very likely face a new flooding threat at some time in this century as sea levels rise because of projected climate change.\nCities Tend to Concentrate Pollution and Health \nProblems. Because of their high population densities and rates of resource consumption, cities produce most of the world\u2019s air pollution, water pollution, and solid and haz-ardous wastes. Pollutant levels are generally higher be-cause the pollution is produced in a confined area and \n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\nInputs\nEnergyOutputs\nFood\nWater\nRaw", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3745, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57465615-dc26-42ec-8b13-fc2dc882bcc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "57465615-dc26-42ec-8b13-fc2dc882bcc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "G.

In addition, high population densities in urban areas can promote the spread of infec-tious diseases, especially if adequate drinking water and sewage systems are not in place.\nCities Have Excessive Noise. Most urban dwellers are \nsubjected to noise pollution: any unwanted, disturbing, or harmful sound that damages, impairs, or interferes with hearing, causes stress, hampers concentration and work efficiency, or causes accidents. Noise levels are measured in decibel-A (dbA) sound pressure units that vary with different human activities (Figure 6.19).\nSound pressure becomes damaging at about 85 dbA \nand painful at around 120 dbA. At 180 dbA, sound can kill. Prolonged exposure to sound levels above 85 dbA can cause permanent hearing damage. Just one-and-a-half minutes of exposure to 110 decibels or more can cause such damage. You are being exposed to a sound level high enough to cause permanent hearing damage if a noise requires you to raise your voice to be heard, if a noise causes your ears to ring, or if a noise makes nearby speech seem muffled. Prolonged exposure to lower noise levels and occasional loud sounds may not damage your hearing, but these sound levels can be very stressful.\nNoise pollution can be reduced by modifying noisy \nactivities, shielding noisy activities or processes, shielding workers or other persons from the noise, moving noisy operations or machines away, and using antinoise (various technologies that cancel or muffle one noise with another).\nCities Affect Local Climates. On average, cities tend \nto be warmer, rainier, foggier, and cloudier than suburbs and nearby rural areas. In cities, the enormous amount of heat generated by cars, factories, furnaces, lights, air con-ditioners, and heat-absorbing dark roofs and streets creates an urban heat island that is surrounded by cooler suburban \nand rural areas. As cities grow and merge, their heat is-lands merge, which can reduce the natural dilution and cleansing of polluted air. The urban heat island effect can also greatly increase dependence on air conditioning. This in turn leads to higher energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and other forms of air pollution.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Disadvantages of Urbanization\nWhich two of these disadvantages of urbanization do you think are the most \nserious? explain.\nLife Is a Desperate Struggle for the Urban \nPoor in Less-Developed Countries\nPoverty is a way of life for many urban dwellers in less-\ndeveloped countries. According to a UN study, the number of urban residents living in poverty\u2014now about 1 bil-lion\u2014could reach 1.4 billion by 2020.\nSome of these people live in crowded slums\u2014areas \ndominated by dilapidated tenements, or rooming houses where several people might live in a single room (see chapter-opening photo). Other poor people live in squatter settlements and shantytowns on the outskirts of cities. They build shacks from corrugated metal, plastic sheets, scrap wood, and other scavenged building materials, or they live in rusted shipping containers and junked cars.\nPoor people living in shantytowns and squatter settle-\nments, or on the streets, usually lack clean water supplies, sewers, electricity, and roads, and are subject to severe air and water pollution and hazardous wastes from nearby factories. Many of these settlements are in locations espe-cially prone to landslides, flooding, or earthquakes. Some city governments regularly bulldoze squatter shacks and send police to drive illegal settlers out.

More than one-third of its residents live in slums called barrios or in squatter set-tlements that lack running water and electricity. At least 3 million people in the barrios have no sewage facilities, so human waste from these slums is deposited in gutters, vacant lots, and open ditches every day, attracting rats and flies. When the winds pick up dried excrement, a fecal snow blankets parts of the city. This bacteria-laden fallout leads to widespread salmonella and hepatitis infections, espe-cially among children.\nIn 1992, the United Nations named Mexico City \u201cthe \nmost polluted city on the planet.\u201d Since then Mexico City has made progress in reducing the severity of some of its air pollution problems. In 2013, the Institute for Transpor -\ntation and Development awarded Mexico City its Sustain-able Transportation Award for expanding its bus rapid- transit system, rebuilding its public parks, reducing crime, and expanding its bike sharing program and its bike lanes. The percentage of days each year in which air pollution standards are violated has fallen from 50% to 20% and ozone and other air pollutants are now at about the same level as those of Los Angeles, California.\nThe city government has moved refineries and factories \nout of the city, banned cars in its central zone, and required air pollution controls on all cars made after 1991. It has also phased out the use of leaded gasoline, expanded public transportation, and replaced some old buses, taxis, and de-livery trucks with vehicles that produce fewer emissions.\nMexico City still has a long way to go as its human \npopulation increases along with its number of motor ve-hicles. However, this story shows what can be done to improve environmental quality once a community decides to act.\n6.6 HOW DOES TRANSPORTATION \nAFFECT URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS?\nCONCEPT 6.6   In some countries, many people live in \nwidely dispersed urban areas and depend mostly on motor \nvehicles for their transportation, which greatly expands their ecological footprints.\nCities Can Grow Outward or Upward\nIf a city cannot spread outward, it must grow vertically\u2014\nupward and downward (below ground)\u2014so that it occu-pies a small land area with a high population density. Most GOOD\nNEWSpeople living in compact cities such as Hong Kong, China, \nand Tokyo, Japan, get around by walking, biking, or using mass transit such as rail and bus systems.\nIn other parts of the world, a combination of plentiful \nland and networks of highways have produced dispersed cities whose residents depend on motor vehicles for most travel (Concept 6.6). Such car-centered cities are found in the United States, Canada, Australia, and some other countries where ample land is available for cities to ex-pand outward. The resulting urban sprawl can have a number of undesirable effects (Figure 6.17).\nThe United States is a prime example of a car-centered \nnation. With 4.4% of the world\u2019s people, the country has about 25% of the world\u2019s 1 billion motor vehicles, accord-ing to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In its dis-persed urban areas, passenger vehicles are used for 86% of all transportation and 76% of urban residents drive alone to work every day (up from 64% in 1980).\nUse of Motor Vehicles Has Advantages  \nand Disadvantages\nMotor vehicles provide mobility and offer a convenient \nand comfortable way to get from one place to another. For many people, driving is personally satisfying. Also, much of the world\u2019s economy is built on producing motor vehi-cles and supplying fuel, roads, services, and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3752, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30cc701b-01e3-44b3-b38e-6e605c8deae5": {"__data__": {"id_": "30cc701b-01e3-44b3-b38e-6e605c8deae5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "G.

Globally, automobile accidents kill about 1.3 million peo-ple per year\u2014an average of more than 3,500 deaths per day\u2014and injure another 50 million people. They also kill about 50 million wild animals and family pets every year.\nEach year, motor vehicle accidents in the United States \nkill about 32,000 people and injure another 2 million, at least 300,000 of them severely. Car accidents have killed more Americans than have all the wars in the country\u2019s history.\nMotor vehicles are the world\u2019s largest source of out-\ndoor air pollution, which causes 30,000\u201360,000 premature deaths per year in the United States, according to the En-vironmental Protection Agency. They are also the fastest-growing source of climate-changing CO\n2 emissions. At \nleast a third of the world\u2019s urban land and half of that in the United States is devoted to roads, parking lots, gasoline stations, and other automobile-related uses.\nAnother problem is congestion. If current trends con-\ntinue, U.S. motorists will spend an average of 2 years of their lives in traffic jams, as streets and freeways will more often resemble parking lots. Traffic congestion in some cities in less-developed countries is much worse. Building more roads is not likely the answer because more roads usually encourage more people to use motor vehicles.\n90446_ch06_100-127.indd   119 8/13/14   8:31 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

According to a study by the International Center for Technology Assessment, such a tax would amount to about $3.18 per liter ($12 per gal-lon) of gasoline in the United States. Gradually phasing in such a tax, as has been done in many European nations, could spur the use of more energy-efficient motor vehicles and mass transit. It would also reduce pollution and envi-ronmental degradation and help to slow projected climate change and ocean acidification.\nProponents of higher gasoline taxes urge governments \nto do two major things. First, fund programs to educate people about the hidden costs they are paying for their automobile use. Second, use gasoline tax revenues to help finance mass transit systems, bike lanes, and sidewalks as alternatives to cars, and also to reduce taxes on income, wages, and wealth to offset the increased taxes on gaso-line. Such a tax shift would help to make higher gasoline taxes more politically and economically acceptable.\nTaxing gasoline heavily would be difficult in the United \nStates, for three reasons. First, it faces strong opposition from people who feel they are already overtaxed, many of whom are largely unaware of the hidden costs they are paying for gasoline. The other opposition group is made up of the powerful transportation-related industries such as carmakers, oil and tire companies, road builders, and many real estate developers. Second, the dispersed nature of most U.S. urban areas makes people dependent on cars, and thus higher taxes would be an economic burden for them. In 2012, according to the U.S. Department of Trans-portation, 10% of U.S. workers carpooled (down from 20% in 1980), 5% used mass transit (down from 6% in 1980), and 3% biked or walked to work (down from 6% in 1980). Third, fast, efficient, reliable, and affordable mass transit options, bike lanes, and sidewalks are not widely available in the United States, primarily because most of the revenue from gasoline taxes is used for building and improving highways for motor vehicles.\nAnother way to reduce automobile use and urban con-\ngestion is to raise parking fees and charge tolls on roads, tunnels, and bridges leading into cities\u2014especially during peak traffic times. Densely populated Singapore is rarely congested because it auctions the rights to buy a car, and drivers are charged a fee every time they enter the city. Several European cities have also imposed stiff fees for motor vehicle use in their central cities, while others have banned the parking of cars on city streets and established networks of bike lanes.\nMore than 300 European cities have car-sharing net-\nworks that provide short-term rental of cars. Portland, Or -\negon (Core Case Study), was the first U.S. city to develop a car-sharing system. Network members reserve a car in ad-vance or contact the network and are directed to the closest car. In Berlin, Germany, car sharing has cut car ownership FIGURE 6.20   Widespread bicycle \nuse and a light-rail system, in op-\neration since 1986, have helped to reduce car use in Portland, Oregon (Core Case Study).\nKen Hawkins/Alamy\n90446_ch06_100-127.indd   120 8/13/14   8:31 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

It uses zoning laws and other tools to channel growth in order to reduce its ecological footprint.\nSome critics contend that by limiting urban expansion, \nsmart growth can lead to higher land and housing prices. Supporters counter that it controls and directs sprawl, pro-tects ecologically sensitive and important lands and water -\nways, and results in neighborhoods that are enjoyable places to live. Figure 6.25 lists some of the widely used smart growth tools.\nThe Eco-City Concept: Cities for People, \nNot Cars\nMany environmental scientists and urban planners call for \nus to make new and existing urban areas more sustainable and enjoyable places to live through good ecological de-sign\u2014an important way to increase our beneficial envi-ronmental impact.\nAn eco-city is a people-oriented city, not a car-oriented \ncity. Its residents are able to walk, bike, or use low-polluting mass transit for most of their travel. Its buildings, vehicles, and appliances meet high energy-efficiency stan-dards. Trees and plants adapted to the local climate and soils are planted throughout the city to provide shade, beauty, and wildlife habitats, and to reduce air pollution, noise, and soil erosion.\nIn an eco-city, abandoned lots and industrial sites are \ncleaned up and used. Nearby forests, grasslands, wetlands, and farms are preserved. Much of the food that people eat comes from nearby organic farms, solar greenhouses, community gardens, and small gardens on rooftops, in yards, and in window boxes. Parks are easily available to everyone. People who design and live in eco-cities take seriously the advice that U.S. urban planner Lewis Mum-ford gave more than 3 decades ago: \u201cForget the damned motor car and build cities for lovers and friends.\u201d\nGOOD\nNEWSThe eco-city model is not a futuristic dream, but a \ngrowing reality in a number of cities, including Portland, \nOregon (Core Case Study), that are striving to be-come more environmentally sustainable and liv-able. Other examples are Curitiba, Brazil (see the following Case Study); Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Waitakere City, New Zea-land; Stockholm, Sweden; Helsinki, Finland; Copenhagen, Denmark; Melbourne, Australia; Vancouver, Canada; Leicester, England; Neerlands, the Netherlands; and in the United States, Davis, California; Olympia, Washington; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.\nSmart Growth Tools\nLimits and \nRegulations\nLimit building \npermits\nDraw urban \ngrowth boundaries\nCreate greenbelts \naround cities\nZoning\nPromote mixed \nuse of housing and small businesses\nConcentrate \ndevelopment along mass transportation routes\nPlanning\nEcological \nland-use planning\nEnvironmental \nimpact analysis\nIntegrated \nregional planningProtection\nPreserve open spaceBuy new open spaceProhibit certain types \nof development\nTaxesTax land, not \nbuildings\nTax land on value of \nactual use instead of on highest value as developed land\nTax BreaksFor owners agreeing \nnot to allow certain types of development\nFor cleaning up  \nand developing abandoned urban sites\nRevitalization and \nNew Growth\nRevitalize existing \ntowns and cities\nBuild well-planned \nnew towns and villages within cities\nSolutions\nFIGURE", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3712, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "526ebbf3-dddc-4982-a7e7-c125d4476ce6": {"__data__": {"id_": "526ebbf3-dddc-4982-a7e7-c125d4476ce6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "G.

In 1969, planners in this city decided to focus on an inexpensive and efficient mass-transit system rather than on the car.\nCuritiba\u2019s superb bus rapid-transit (BRT) system moves \nlarge numbers of passengers efficiently, including 72% of the city\u2019s commuters. Each of the system\u2019s five major \u201cspokes,\u201d connecting the city center to outlying districts (see map in Figure 6.26), has two express lanes used only by buses. Double- and triple-length bus sections are cou-pled together as needed to carry up to 300 passengers. Boarding is speeded up by the use of extra-wide bus doors and covered boarding platforms where passengers can pay before getting on the bus (Figure 6.26).\nOnly high-rise apartment buildings are allowed near \nmajor bus routes, and the bottom two floors of each build-ing must be devoted to stores\u2014a practice that reduces the need for residents to travel. Cars are banned from 49 blocks in the center of the downtown area, which has a network of pedestrian walkways connected to bus sta-tions, parks, and bicycle paths running throughout most of the city. Consequently, Curitiba uses less energy per per -\nson and has lower emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants and less traffic congestion than do most comparably sized cities.\nAlong the six streams that run within Curitiba\u2019s bor -\nders, the city removed most buildings and lined the streams with a series of interconnected parks. Volunteers have planted more than 1.5 million trees throughout the city, and no one can cut down a tree without a permit, which also requires that two trees must be planted for each one that is cut down.\nCuritiba recycles roughly 70% of its paper and 60% of \nits metal, glass, and plastic. Recovered materials are sold mostly to the city\u2019s 500 or more major industries, which must meet strict pollution standards.\nCuritiba\u2019s poor residents receive free medical and den-\ntal care, child care, and job training, and 40 feeding centers are available for street children. People who live in areas not served by garbage trucks can collect garbage and ex-change filled garbage bags for surplus food, bus tokens, and school supplies. The city uses old buses as roving class-rooms to train its poor in basic job skills. Other retired buses have become health clinics, soup kitchens, and day-care centers that are free for low-income parents.\nCity centerExpress\nInterdistrictDirectFeederWorkersRoute\nFIGURE 6.26   Solutions: Curitiba\u2019s bus rapid-transit system has \ngreatly reduced car use in this Brazilian city.\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\nCarlos Cazalis/Corbis\n90446_ch06_100-127.indd   123 8/13/14   8:32 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

All \nschool children study ecology. Polls show that 99% of the city\u2019s inhabitants would not want to live anywhere else.\nCuritiba does face challenges, as do all cities, mostly \ndue to a fivefold increase in its population since 1965. Its once-clear streams are often overloaded with pollutants. The bus system is nearing capacity, and car ownership is on the rise. The city is considering building a light-rail sys-tem to relieve some of the pressure.\nThis internationally acclaimed model of urban plan-\nning and sustainability is the brainchild of architect and former college professor Jaime Lerner, who has served as the city\u2019s mayor three times since 1969.\nIn this chapter,  we looked at the growth of the \nhuman population and urban areas, their environmental im-\npacts, ways to slow population growth, and how we can make urban areas more sustainable and livable as Portland, Oregon (Core Case Study) and Curitiba, Brazil are doing.The three scientific principles of sustainability\u2014reli-\nance on solar energy, chemical cycling, and biodiversity\u2014can guide us in dealing with the problems brought on by popula-tion growth and by urban growth. By employing solar and other renewable energy technologies more widely, we can cut \npollution and emissions of climate-changing gases that are increasing as the population, re-source use per person, and urban areas grow. By reusing and recycling more materials, we could cut our waste and reduce our ecological foot-prints. And in focusing on preserving biodiversity, we could help to sustain the life-support system on which we and all other species depend, thereby increasing our beneficial environmental impact.\nMaking this transition toward sustainability is \nalso in keeping with the three social science principles of sustainability. Full-cost pricing re-quires that the harmful environmental costs of urbanization be included in the market prices of goods and services. To achieve this, people would have to work together to find win-win so-lutions to population and urban problems. And by implementing these solutions, we would be applying the ethical principle that calls for our leaving the world in a more sustainable condi-tion for future generations.TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nPortland, Oregon, Population Growth, and Sustainability\nJeremy Richards/Shutterstock\u2022 The human population and the global rate of \nresource use per person are both growing and \nputting an increasing strain on the earth\u2019s natural capital.\n\u2022\n We can slow human population growth  \nby reducing poverty through economic \ndevelopment, elevating the status of women,  and encouraging family planning.\n\u2022\n Most urban areas, home to more than half of \nthe world\u2019s people, are unsustainable systems \nthat can be made more sustainable and livable.BIG IDEAS\n90446_ch06_100-127.indd   124 8/13/14   8:32 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Portland, Oregon (Core Case Study) has made signifi-\ncant progress in becoming a more environmentally sustainable and desirable place to live. If you live in an urban area, what steps, if any, has your commu-nity taken toward becoming more environmentally sustainable? What further steps could be taken?\n 2. Do you think that the global population of 7.1 billion is too large? Explain. If your answer was yes, what do you think should be done to slow human population growth? If your answer was no, do you believe that there is a population size that would be too big? Ex-plain. Do you think that the population of the coun-try where you live is too large? Explain.\n 3. If you could say hello to a new person every second without taking a break and working around the clock, how many years would it take you to greet the 85 million people who were added to the world\u2019s population in 2013? (Hint: start by dividing 85 mil-lion seconds by 60 to find the number of minutes, and go from there to find the number of years.) How many years would it take for you to greet 7.1 billion people?\n 4. Identify a major local, national, or global environ-mental problem, and describe the role that popula-tion growth plays in this problem. 5. Some people think that our most important environ-mental goal should be to sharply reduce the rate of population growth in less-developed countries, where at least 92% of the world\u2019s population growth is expected to take place between now and 2050. Others argue that the most serious environmental problems stem from high levels of resource con-sumption per person in more-developed countries, which have much larger ecological footprints per person than do less-developed countries. What is your view on this issue? Explain.\n 6. If you own a car or hope to own one, what condi-tions, if any, would encourage you to rely less on your car and to travel to school or work by bicycle, on foot, by mass transit, or by carpool?\n 7. Do you think the United States (or the country in which you live) should develop a comprehensive and integrated mass-transit system over the next 20 years, including an efficient rapid-rail network for travel within and between its major cities? Explain.  \nIf so, how would you pay for such a system?\n 8. Consider the characteristics of an eco-city listed on  \np. 122.  How close to this eco-city model is the city in \nwhich you live or the city nearest to where you live? Pick what you think are the five most important characteristics of an eco-city and, for each of these characteristics, describe a way in which your city could attain it.\nDoing Environmental Science\nThe campus where you go to school is something like an urban community. Choose five eco-city characteristics  \n(p. 122) and apply them to your campus.\n For each \ncharacteristic:\n 1. Create a scale of 1 to 10 in order to rate the campus on how well it does in having that characteristic. (For example, how well does it do in giving students options for getting around, other than by using a car? A rating of 1 could be not at all, while a rating of 10 could be excellent.)\n 2. Do some research and rate your campus for each characteristic.\n 3. Write an explanation of your research process and why you chose each rating.\nWrite a proposed plan for how the campus could improve its ratings.\n90446_ch06_100-127.indd   126 8/13/14   8:32 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

They slowly build reefs by secreting a protective crust of limestone (calcium carbonate) around their soft bodies. When the polyps die, their empty crusts remain behind as part of a platform for more reef growth. The resulting elaborate network of crevices, ledges, and holes serves as calcium carbonate \u201ccondo-miniums\u201d for a variety of marine animals.\nCoral reefs are the result of a \nmutually beneficial relationship between polyps and tiny single-celled algae called zooxanthellae  (\u201czoh-ZAN-thel-ee\u201d) that live in the tissues of the polyps. In this example of mutualism (see Chapter 5, p. 88), the algae provide the polyps with food and oxygen through photosynthesis, and help the corals produce calcium carbonate.\n Algae also give the reefs \ntheir stunning coloration. The polyps, in turn, provide the algae with a well-protected home and some of their nutrients.\nAlthough shallow and deep-water \ncoral reefs occupy only about 0.2% of the ocean floor, they provide important ecosystem and economic services. They act as natural barriers that help to pro-tect 15% of the world\u2019s coastlines from flooding and erosion caused by battering waves and storms. They also provide habitats, food, and spawning grounds for one-quarter to one-third of the organisms that live in the ocean, and they produce about one-tenth of the global fish catch. Through tourism and fishing they provide goods and services worth about $40 billion a year.\nCoral reefs are vulnerable to dam-\nage because they grow slowly and are disrupted easily. Runoff of soil and other materials from the land can cloud the water and block the sunlight that the algae in shallow reefs need for photosynthesis. Also, the water in which shallow reefs live must have a temperature of 18\u201330\u00b0C (64\u201386\u00b0F) and cannot be too acidic. This explains why the two major long-term threats to coral reefs are projected climate change, which could raise the water temperature above tolerable limits in most reef areas, and ocean acidifica-tion, which could make it harder for polyps to build reefs and could even dissolve some of their calcium carbon-ate formations.\nOne result of stresses such as pol-\nlution and rising ocean water temper -\natures is coral bleaching (Figure 7.1). Such stressors can cause the colorful algae, upon which corals depend for food, to die off. Without food, the coral polyps die, leaving behind a white skeleton of calcium carbonate. Studies by the Global Coral Reef Mon-itoring Network and other scientist \ngroups estimate that since the \n1950s, some 45% to 53% of \nthe world\u2019s shallow coral reefs \nhave been destroyed or \ndegraded and that \nanother 25% to 33% \ncould be lost within 20 \nto 40 years. These cen-\nters of biodiversity are by far the most threat-ened marine ecosystems.\nIn this chapter, we \nexplore the factors that \ndetermine climate, the \nnature of terrestrial and \naquatic ecosystems, and the \neffects of human activities on \nthese forms of natural capital.Why Should We Care about Coral Reefs?\n130 istockphoto.com/RainervonBrandis\nFIGURE 7.1   This bleached coral has lost most of \nits algae because of changes in the \nenvironment such as warm-ing of the waters and deposition of sediments.\n90446_ch07_128-159.indd   130 8/13/14   8:35 AMCopyright 2016", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3586, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dab1a5f1-09f3-46f6-9ce0-0b053e05e494": {"__data__": {"id_": "dab1a5f1-09f3-46f6-9ce0-0b053e05e494", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "G.

Weather is a set of physical condi-tions of the lower atmosphere, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and other factors, in a given area over a period of hours or days. The most important factors in the weather of any area are atmospheric temperature and precipitation.\nWeather differs from climate, which is the general \npattern of atmospheric conditions in a given area over periods ranging from at least three decades to thousands of years. Weather often fluctuates daily, from one season to another, and from one year to the next. However, climate tends to change slowly because it is the average of weather conditions and their fluctuations in a given area over at least 30 years.\nBased on such data, scientists describe the various re-\ngions of the earth according to their climates. Figure 7.2 shows these major climate zones along with the major ocean currents\u2014mass movements of surface and deep ocean water. These currents help to determine regional climates.\nClimate varies among the earth\u2019s different regions pri-\nmarily because, over long periods of time, patterns of global air circulation and ocean currents distribute heat and precipitation unevenly between the tropics and other parts of the world (Figure 7.3). Three major factors affect the circulation of air in the lower atmosphere:\n1.\n Uneven heating of the earth\u2019s surface by the sun. Air is \nheated much more at the equator, where the sun\u2019s rays strike directly, than at the poles, where sunlight strikes at an angle and spreads out over a much greater area (Figure 7.3, left). These differences in the input of solar energy to the atmosphere help explain why tropical \nANIMATED FIGURE 7.2   Natural capital: This generalized map of the earth\u2019s current climate zones \nalso shows the major ocean currents and upwelling areas (where currents bring nutrients from the \nocean bottom to the surface).

This creates global patterns of prevailing  \nwinds that help to distribute heat and moisture in the  \natmosphere, which leads to the earth\u2019s variety  \nof forests, grasslands, and deserts (right).\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\nregions near the equator are hot, why polar regions are \ncold, and why temperate regions in between generally have both warm and cool temperatures (Figure 7.2). The intense input of solar radiation in tropical regions leads to greatly increased evaporation of moisture from forests, grasslands, and bodies of water. As a result, tropical regions normally receive more precipitation than do other areas of the earth. The amount of solar energy reaching the earth also varies slightly (typically by less than 0.1%) over the 11-year solar activity cycle that includes sunspots and other solar events.\n2.\n Rotation of the earth on its axis. As the earth rotates around its axis, the equator spins faster than the regions to its north and south. This means that air masses moving to the north or south are deflected to the east, because they are also moving easterly (the direction of the earth\u2019s rotation) faster than the land below them\u2014a process known as the Coriolis effect. For the same reason, air moving from the north or south toward the equator will curl in a westerly direction (Figure 7.3, left) because it is moving east more slowly than the land below it as it moves toward the equator. Also, the atmosphere is divided into six huge regions, three on either side of the equator (Figure 7.3, right), called Hadley cells, in which warm air rises and cools, \nthen falls and heats up again in great rolling patterns. Those cells that bring the surface air toward the equator cause westerly winds (hooking west because of the Coriolis effect, Figure 7.3, left) and those in which surface air moves toward the poles cause easterly winds. These easterly and westerly wind patterns are called prevailing winds\u2014major surface winds that blow almost continuously and help to distribute heat and moisture over the earth\u2019s surface and to drive surface ocean currents.\n3.\n Properties of air, water, and land. Heat from the sun evaporates ocean water and transfers heat from the oceans to the atmosphere, especially near the hot equator. This evaporation of water creates the giant cyclical Hadley cells (Figure 7.3, right) that circulate air, heat, and moisture both vertically and from place to place in the atmosphere, as shown in Figure 7.4.\nDriven by prevailing winds and the earth\u2019s rotation, \nthe earth\u2019s major ocean currents (Figure 7.2) help to redis-\ntribute heat from the sun, thereby influencing climate and vegetation, especially near coastal areas.

This creates a con-\nnected loop of deep and shallow ocean currents (which are separate from those shown in Figure 7.2). This loop acts somewhat like a giant conveyer belt that moves heat from the surface to the deep sea and transfers warm and cold water between the tropics and the poles (Figure 7.5).\nThe oceans and the atmosphere are strongly linked in \ntwo ways: ocean currents are affected by winds in the at-mosphere, and heat from the oceans affects atmospheric circulation. One example of the interactions between the oceans and the atmosphere is the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscilla-tion, or ENSO (Figure 7.6). This large-scale weather phe-\nnomenon occurs every few years when prevailing winds in the tropical Pacific Ocean weaken and change direction. The resulting above-average warming of Pacific waters alters the weather over at least two-thirds of the earth for 1 or 2 years by, for example, leading to one or two milder winters in some areas.\nThe earth\u2019s air circulation patterns, prevailing winds, \nand configuration of continents and oceans are all factors FIGURE 7.4   energy is transferred by convection in the atmo-\nsphere\u2014the process by which warm, wet air rises, then cools and re-\nleases heat and moisture as precipitation (right side and top, center).

Together, all of \nthese factors lead to an irregular distribution of climates and of the resulting deserts, grasslands, and forests, as shown in Figure 7.3, right (Concept 7.1).\nGreenhouse Gases Warm the  \nLower Atmosphere\nAs energy flows from the sun to the earth, some of it is \nreflected by the earth\u2019s surface back into the atmosphere. Molecules of certain gases in the atmosphere, including water vapor (H\n2O), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), \nand nitrous oxide (N 2O), absorb some of this solar energy \nand release a portion of it as infrared radiation (heat) that warms the lower atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface. These gases, called greenhouse gases, play a role in de-termining the lower atmosphere\u2019s average temperatures and thus the earth\u2019s climates. This natural warming of the lower atmosphere is called the greenhouse effect (see Figure 3.3, p. 44). Without this natural warming effect, the earth would be a very cold and mostly lifeless planet.\nHuman activities such as the production and burning \nof fossil fuels, clearing of forests, and growing of crops release large quantities of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. A considerable body of scientific evidence, combined with climate model projections, indicates that we are emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere faster than they can be re-moved by the earth\u2019s carbon and nitrogen cycles (see Figures 3.14,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3551, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36da420e-6243-4d52-abd3-90c51a8264db": {"__data__": {"id_": "36da420e-6243-4d52-abd3-90c51a8264db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "G.

For example, moun-tains interrupt the flow of prevailing surface winds and the movement of storms. When moist air blowing inland from an ocean reaches a mountain range, it is forced upward. As it rises, it cools and expands, and loses most of its mois-ture as rain and snow that fall on the windward slope of the mountain.As the drier air mass passes over the mountaintops, it \nflows down the leeward slopes (facing away from the wind), and warms up. This warmer air can hold more moisture, but it typically does not release much of this moisture and instead tends to dry out plants and soil be-low. This process is called the rain shadow effect (Figure 7.7), and over many decades, it results in semiarid or arid conditions on the leeward side of a high mountain range. Sometimes this effect leads to the formation of deserts such as Death Valley, a part of the Mojave Desert, which lies within the U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.FIGURE 7.6   Normal prevailing, or trade winds blowing east to west cause shore upwellings of cold, \nnutrient-rich bottom water in the tropical pacific Ocean near the coast of peru (left). every few years, a \nshift in trade winds, known as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), disrupts this pattern for 1\u20132 years.\nEQUATOR\nAUSTRALIA\nWarm water\nCold waterThermoclineSOUTH\nAMERICAAUSTRALIASOUTHAMERICA\nWarm water\nCold waterThermoclineWarm water deepens off\nSouth America\nNormal Conditions El Ni\u00f1o ConditionsWarm waters\npushed westwardSurface winds\nblow westwardDrought inAustralia andSoutheast AsiaWinds weaken,causing updraftsand storms\nWarm water /f_lowstopped or reversed\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\nPrevailing winds\npick up moisturefrom an ocean.On the windward side of a\nmountain range, air rises,cools, and releases moisture.On the leeward side of the mountain\nrange, air descends, warms, andreleases little moisture, causing rainshadow effect.\nFIGURE 7.7   The rain shadow effect is a reduction of rainfall and loss of moisture from the landscape \non the leeward side of a mountain.

As a result, cities on average tend to have more haze and smog, higher tem-peratures, and lower wind speeds than the surrounding countryside, and these factors make them heat islands.\n7.2 WHAT ARE THE WORLD\u2019S \nMAJOR TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS AND HOW  ARE HUMAN ACTIVITIES AFFECTING THEM?\nCONCEPT 7.2A   Differences in long-term average annual \nprecipitation and temperature lead to the formation of \ntropical, temperate, and cold deserts, grasslands, and for -\nests, and largely determine their locations.\nCONCEPT 7.2B   human activities are disrupting ecosystem \nand economic services provided by many of the earth\u2019s des-erts, grasslands, forests, and mountains.Climate Helps to Determine Where \nTerrestrial Organisms Can Live\nDifferences in climate (Figure 7.2) help to explain why one \narea of the earth\u2019s land surface is a desert, another a grass-land, and another a forest. (See Figure 2, p. S16, Supple-ment 4.)\n Different combinations of varying average annual \nprecipitation and temperatures, along with global air circu-lation patterns and ocean currents, lead to the formation of tropical (hot), temperate (moderate), and polar (cold) des-erts, grasslands, and forests, as summarized in Figure 7.8 (Concept 7.2A).\nClimate and vegetation vary according to latitude and \nalso according to elevation, or height above sea level. If you climb a tall mountain, from its base to its summit, you can observe changes in plant life similar to those you would encounter in traveling from the equator to the earth\u2019s northern polar region (Figure 7.9).\nFigure 7.10 shows how scientists have divided the \nworld into several major biomes\u2014large terrestrial re-gions, each characterized by a particular type of climate and a certain combination of dominant plant life. The va-riety of terrestrial biomes and aquatic systems is one of the four components of the earth\u2019s biodiversity (see Figure 4.2, p. 65)\u2014a vital part of the earth\u2019s natural capital.

But at night, most of the heat stored in the ground radiates quickly into the atmosphere. This explains why in a desert, you may roast during the day but shiver at night.\nA combination of low rainfall and varying average \ntemperatures creates a variety of desert types\u2014tropical, temperate, and cold (Figures 7.8 and 7.10 and Concept 7.2A). Tropical deserts (Figure 7.11, top photo) such as the \nSahara and the Namib of Africa are hot and dry most of the year (Figure 7.11, top graph). They have few plants and a hard, windblown surface strewn with rocks and sand.\nIn temperate deserts (Figure 7.11, center photo) daytime \ntemperatures are high in summer and low in winter and there is more precipitation than in tropical deserts (Figure 7.11, center graph). The sparse vegetation consists mostly of widely dispersed, drought-resistant shrubs and cacti or other succulents adapted to the dry conditions and tem-perature variations.\nIn cold deserts such as the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, \nvegetation is sparse (Figure 7.11, bottom photo). Winters are cold, summers are warm or hot, and precipitation is low (Figure 7.11, bottom graph). In all types of deserts, plants and animals have evolved adaptations that help them to stay cool and to get enough water to survive (Science Focus 7.1).\nDesert ecosystems are fragile because they have slow \nplant growth, low species diversity, slow nutrient cy-cling (due to low bacterial activity in the soils), and very little water. It can take decades to centuries for their soils to recover from disturbances such as off-road ve-hicle traffic, which can also destroy the habitats for a variety of animal species that live underground. The lack of vegetation, especially in tropical and polar des-erts, also makes them vulnerable to heavy wind erosion from sandstorms.ure 4.4 (p. 67) shows how major biomes along the 39th parallel in the United States are related to different cli-mates. The map in Figure 5, p. S20, in Supplement 4 \nshows the major biomes in North America.\nOn maps such as the one in Figure 7.10, biomes are \nshown with sharp boundaries, and each biome is covered with one general type of vegetation. In reality, biomes are not uniform. They consist of a mosaic of patches, each with somewhat different biological communities but with simi-larities typical of the biome. These patches occur primarily because of the irregular distribution of the resources needed by plants and animals and because human activi-ties have removed or altered the natural vegetation in many areas.\nThere are also differences along the transition zone \n(called the ecotone) between two different ecosystems or biomes. This zone contains habitats that are common to both ecosystems along with other habitats that are unique to the transition zone. This results in the edge effect, or \nthe tendency for a transition zone between two different ecosystems to have greater species diversity and a higher density of organisms than are found in either of the indi-vidual ecosystems.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Biomes, Climate, and Human", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3547, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05bdf0f5-b22b-4095-aac4-10f739609880": {"__data__": {"id_": "05bdf0f5-b22b-4095-aac4-10f739609880", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "G.

Grasslands persist because of a combination of seasonal drought, grazing by large herbivores, and occasional fires\u2014all of which keep shrubs and trees from growing in large numbers.\nThe three main types of grassland\u2014tropical, temper -\nate, and cold (arctic tundra)\u2014result from combinations of low average precipitation and varying average tempera-tures (Concept 7.2A). One type of tropical grassland, called a savanna (Figure 7.12, top photo), contains widely scattered clumps of trees. This biome usually has warm temperatures year-round and alternating dry and wet sea-sons (Figure 7.12, top graph).\nTropical savannas in East Africa are home to grazing (pri-\nmarily grass-eating) and browsing (twig- and leaf-nibbling) hoofed animals, including wildebeests, gazelles, zebras, giraffes, and antelopes, as well as their predators such as lions, hyenas, and humans. Herds of these grazing and browsing animals migrate to find water and food in re-sponse to seasonal and year-to-year variations in rainfall (Figure 7.12, blue areas in top graph) and food availability. Savanna plants, like those in deserts, are adapted to sur -\nvive drought and extreme heat; many have deep roots that can tap into groundwater.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Grassland Niches and Feeding Habits\nAs an example of differing niches, some large herbivores have evolved special-\nized eating habits that minimize competition among species for the vegetation found on the savanna. For example, giraffes eat leaves and shoots from the tops of trees, elephants eat leaves and branches farther down, wildebeests prefer short grasses, and zebras graze on longer grasses and stems.\nIn a temperate grassland, winters can be bitterly cold, \nsummers are hot and dry, and annual precipitation is fairly \nsparse and falls unevenly throughout the year (Figure 7.12, center graph). Because the aboveground parts of most of the grasses die and decompose each year, organic matter accumulates to produce deep, fertile topsoil. This topsoil is held in place by a thick network of the grasses\u2019 intertwined roots (unless the topsoil is plowed up, which exposes it to high winds found in these biomes).

Many of the world\u2019s natural temperate grasslands have been con-verted to farmland, because their fertile soils are useful for growing crops (Figure 7.13) and grazing cattle.\nCold grasslands, or arctic tundra, lie south of the arctic \npolar ice cap (Figures 7.8 and 7.10). During most of the year, these treeless plains are bitterly cold (Figure 7.12, bottom graph), swept by frigid winds, and covered with ice and snow. Winters are long with few hours of daylight, and the scant precipitation falls primarily as snow.\nUnder the snow, this biome is carpeted with a thick, \nspongy mat of low-growing plants. Trees and tall plants cannot survive in the cold and windy tundra because they would lose too much of their heat. Most of the annual growth of the tundra\u2019s plants occurs during the 7- to 8-week summer, when there is daylight almost around the clock.\nOne outcome of the extreme cold is the formation of \npermafrost, underground soil in which captured water stays frozen for more than two consecutive years. During the brief summer, the permafrost layer keeps melted snow and ice from draining into the ground. As a consequence, many shallow lakes, marshes, bogs, ponds, and other sea-sonal wetlands form when snow and frozen surface soil melt on the waterlogged tundra. Hordes of mosquitoes, black flies, and other insects thrive in these shallow sur -\nface pools. They serve as food for large colonies of migra-tory birds (especially waterfowl) that migrate from the south to nest and breed in the tundra\u2019s summer bogs and ponds.\nAnimals in this biome survive the intense winter cold \nthrough adaptations such as thick coats of fur (arctic wolf, arctic fox, and musk oxen) or feathers (snowy owl) and living underground (arctic lemming). In the summer, cari-bou (often called reindeer) and other types of deer migrate to the tundra to graze on its vegetation.\nTundra is a fragile biome. Tundra soils usually are nutri-\nent poor. Because of the short growing season, tundra soil and vegetation recover very slowly from damage or dis\n-\nturbance. Human activities in the arctic tundra\u2014  primarily  \nAdaptations for survival in the desert \nhave two themes: beat the heat and \nevery drop of water counts.\nDesert plants have evolved a num-\nber of strategies based on such adapta-tions. During long hot and dry spells, plants such as mesquite and creosote drop their leaves to survive in a dor -\nmant state. Succulent (fleshy) plants  \nsuch as the saguaro (\u201csah-WA\nh-ro\u201d) \ncactus (Figure 7.11, middle photo) have no leaves that can lose water to the at-mosphere through transpiration. They also store water and synthesize food in their expandable, fleshy tissue and they reduce water loss by opening their pores only at night to take up carbon dioxide (CO\n2). The spines of these and \nmany other desert plants guard them from being eaten by herbivores seeking the precious water they hold.\nSome desert plants use deep roots \nto tap into groundwater. Others such as prickly pear and saguaro cacti use widely spread shallow roots to collect water after brief showers and store it in their spongy tissues.\nSome desert plants conserve water \nby having wax-coated leaves that re-duce water loss.

The three main types of forest\u2014tropical, temperate, and cold (northern coniferous, or boreal)\u2014result from combinations of vary-ing precipitation levels and varying average temperatures (Concept 7.2A) (Figures 7.8 and 7.10).\nTropical rain forests (Figure 7.14, top photo) are found \nnear the equator (Figure 7.8), where hot, moisture-laden air rises and dumps its moisture (Figure 7.3). These lush forests have year-round, uniformly warm temperatures, high humidity, and almost daily heavy rainfall (Figure 7.14, top graph). This fairly constant warm, wet climate is ideal for a wide variety of plants and animals.\nTropical rain forests are dominated by broadleaf ever -\ngreen plants, which keep most of their leaves year-round. The tops of the trees form a dense canopy (Figure 7.14, top photo) that blocks most light from reaching the forest floor. Many of the plants that do live at the ground level have enormous leaves to capture what little sunlight filters down to them.\nSome trees are draped with vines (called lianas) that \nreach for the treetops to gain access to sunlight. In the canopy, the vines grow from one tree to another, providing walkways for many species living there. When a large tree is cut down, its network of lianas can pull down other trees.\nTropical rain forests have a very high net primary pro-\nductivity (see Figure 3.12, p. 50).\n They are teeming with \nlife and possess incredible biological diversity. Although tropical rain forests cover only about 2% of the earth\u2019s land surface, ecologists estimate that they contain at least 50% of the known terrestrial plant and animal species. For example, a single tree in these forests may support several thousand different insect species. Plants from tropical rain forests are a source of a variety of chemicals, many of which have been used as blueprints for making most of the world\u2019s prescription drugs.\nFIGURE 7.13   Natural capital degradation: This intensively cultivated cropland is an example of the \nreplacement of biologically diverse temperate grasslands (such as in the center photo of Figure 7.12) \nwith a monoculture crop.National Archives/EPA Documerica\n90446_ch07_128-159.indd   141 8/13/14   8:35 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Vegetation layers are structured, for the most part, according to the plants\u2019 needs for sunlight, as shown in Figure 7.15. Much of the animal life, particularly insects, bats, and birds, lives in the sunny canopy layer, with its abundant shelter and supplies of leaves, flowers, and fruits. To study life in the treetops, ecologists climb trees (see Chapter 2 opening photo) and build platforms and boardwalks in the upper canopy.\nDropped leaves, fallen trees, and dead animals decom-\npose quickly in tropical rain forests because of the warm, moist conditions and the hordes of decomposers. About 90% of the nutrients released by this rapid decomposition are quickly taken up and stored by trees, vines, and other plants. Nutrients that are not taken up are soon leached from the thin topsoil by the almost daily rainfall. As a re-sult, very little plant litter builds up on the ground. The resulting lack of fertile soil helps to explain why rain for -ests are not good places to clear and grow crops or graze cattle on a sustainable basis.\nAt least half of all tropical rain forests have been de-\nstroyed or disturbed by human activities such as farming, and the pace of this destruction and degradation is increas-ing (see Chapter 3 Core Case Study, p. 42).\n Ecologists \nwarn that without strong protective measures, most of these forests, along with their rich biodiversity and other highly valuable ecosystem services, could be gone by the end of this century.\nThe second major type of forest is the temperate decidu-\nous forest (Figure 7.14, middle photo). Such forests typi-cally see warm summers, cold winters, and abundant precipitation\u2014rain in summer and snow in winter months (Figure 7.14, middle graph). They are dominated by a few species of broadleaf deciduous trees such as oak, hickory, maple, aspen, and birch. Animal species living in these forests include predators such as wolves, foxes, and wild-cats.

Warblers, robins, and other \nbird species live in these forests during the spring and summer, mating and raising their young.\nIn these forests, most of the trees\u2019 leaves, after develop-\ning their vibrant colors in the fall (Figure 7.14, middle photo), drop off the trees. This allows the trees to survive the cold winters by becoming dormant. Each spring, they sprout new leaves and spend their summers growing and producing until the cold weather returns.\nBecause they have cooler temperatures and fewer de-\ncomposers than tropical forests have, these forests also have a slower rate of decomposition. As a result, they ac-cumulate a thick layer of slowly decaying leaf litter, which becomes a storehouse of nutrients.\nOn a global basis, temperate forests have been de-\ngraded by various human activities, especially logging and urban expansion, more than any other terrestrial biome. However, within 100 to 200 years, forests of this type that have been cleared can return through secondary ecologi-cal succession (see Figure 5.8, p. 91).\nAnother type of temperate forest, the coastal coniferous \nforests or temperate rain forests are found in scattered coastal temperate areas with ample rainfall and moisture from dense ocean fogs. Thick stands of these forests with large conifers such as Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, giant sequoia (see Chapter 2 opening photo), and redwoods once domi-nated undisturbed areas of these biomes along the coast of North America, from Canada to Northern California in the United States.\nCold, or northern coniferous forests (Figure 7.14, bottom \nphoto), also called boreal forests or taigas (\u201cTIE-guhs\u201d), are found south of arctic tundra. In their subarctic, cold and moist climate, winters are long and extremely cold, with winter sunlight available only 6\u20138 hours per day in the northernmost taigas. Summers are short, with cool to warm temperatures (Figure 7.14, bottom graph), and the sun shines as long as 19 hours a day during mid-summer.\nMost boreal forests are dominated by a few species of \nconiferous (cone-bearing) evergreen trees or conifers such as spruce, fir, cedar, hemlock, and pine that keep most of their leaves (or needles) year-round. Most of these species have small, needle-shaped, wax-coated leaves that can withstand the intense cold and drought of winter, when snow blankets the ground. Plant diversity is low because few species can survive the winters when soil moisture is frozen.\nBeneath the stands of trees in these forests is a deep \nlayer of partially decomposed conifer needles. Decomposi-tion is slow because of low temperatures, the waxy coating on the needles, and high soil acidity. The decomposing conifer needles make the thin, nutrient-poor topsoil acidic, which prevents most other plants (except certain shrubs) from growing on the forest floor.\nYear-round wildlife includes bears, wolves, moose, \nlynx, and many burrowing rodent species. Caribou spend the winter in taiga and the summer in the arctic tundra (Figure 7.12, bottom). During the brief summer, warblers and other insect-eating birds feed on flies, mosquitoes, and caterpillars.\nMountains Play Important Ecological Roles\nSome of the world\u2019s most spectacular environments are high on mountains (Figure 7.16), steep or high-elevation lands that cover about one-fourth of the earth\u2019s land sur -\nface. Mountains are places where dramatic changes in al-titude, slope, climate, soil, and vegetation take place over very short distances (Figure 7.9, left).\nAbout 1.2 billion people (17%", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3590, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e485e79-24b0-497b-80f3-b45e16ce3fd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e485e79-24b0-497b-80f3-b45e16ce3fd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "G.

Because of the steep slopes, mountain soils are easily eroded when the vegetation holding them in place is removed by natu-ral disturbances such as landslides and avalanches, or by human activities such as timber cutting and agriculture. Many mountains are islands of biodiversity surrounded by a sea of lower-elevation landscapes transformed by human activities.\nMountains play an important ecological role. They \ncontain the majority of the world\u2019s forests, which are habi-tats for much of the planet\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity. They often are habitats for endemic species\u2014those that are found nowhere else on earth. They also serve as sanctuaries for animals that are capable of migrating to higher altitudes and surviving in such environments. Every year, more of these animals are driven from lowland areas to mountain habitats by human activities and by a warming climate.\nFinally, mountains play a critical role in the hydrologic \ncycle (see Figure 3.13, p. 52) by serving as major store-houses of water.\n During winter, precipitation is stored as \nice and snow. In the warmer weather of spring and sum-mer, much of this snow and ice melts, releasing water to streams for use by wildlife and by humans for drinking and for irrigating crops. As the atmosphere has warmed over the last 40 years, some mountaintop snow packs and glaciers have been melting earlier in the spring each year. This is leading to lower food production in certain areas, because much of the water needed throughout the sum-mer to irrigate crops gets released too early in the season and too quickly.\nScientific measurements and climate models indicate \nthat a large number of the world\u2019s mountaintop glaciers may disappear during this century if the atmosphere keeps getting warmer as projected. This could force many people to move from their homelands in search of new water sup-plies and places to grow their crops. Despite the ecological, economic, and cultural importance of mountain ecosys-tems, methods for protecting these areas have largely eluded governments and environmental organizations.\n90446_ch07_128-159.indd   144 8/13/14   8:35 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Although the global ocean is a single and continuous body of saltwater, geographers divide it into five large areas\u2014the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans\u2014separated by the continents. To-gether, the oceans hold almost 98% of the earth\u2019s water. Each of us is connected to, and utterly dependent on, the earth\u2019s global ocean through the water cycle (see Figure 3.13, p. 52).\nThe aquatic equivalents of biomes are called aquatic \nlife zones\u2014saltwater and freshwater portions of the bio-sphere that can support life. The distribution of many aquatic organisms is determined largely by the water\u2019s sa-linity\u2014the amounts of various salts such as sodium chlo-ride dissolved in a given volume of water. As a result, aquatic life zones are classified into two major types: salt-water or marine life zones (oceans and their bays, estu-aries, coastal wetlands, shorelines, coral reefs, and mangrove forests) and freshwater life zones (lakes, riv-ers, streams, and inland wetlands).\nIn most aquatic systems, the key factors determining \nthe types and numbers of organisms found at various depths are water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, avail-\nMajor Human Impacts on Terrestrial Ecosystems\nGrasslands Forests Mountains Deserts\nConversion to \ncropland\nRelease of CO2 to \natmosphere from \nburning grassland\nOvergrazing by \nlivestock Oil production and off-road vehicles in arctic tundraClearing for agriculture, livestock grazing, timber, and urban development\nConversion of diverse \nforests to tree plantations\nDamage from off-road \nvehicles\nPollution of forest streamsAgriculture\nTimber and mineral extractionHydroelectric dams and reservoirsAir pollution blowing in from urban areas \nand power plants\nSoil damage from off-road vehiclesLarge desert cities\nDestruction of soil and \nunderground habitat by off-road vehicles\nDepletion of groundwaterLand disturbance and \npollution from mineral extraction\nNatural Capital Degradation\nFIGURE 7.17   human activities have had major impacts on the world\u2019s deserts, grasslands, forests, \nand mountains, as summarized here.

They are also enormous reservoirs of biodiversity. Marine life is found in three major life zones: the coastal zone, the open sea, and the ocean bottom (Figure 7.19).\nThe coastal zone is the warm, nutrient-rich, shallow \nwater that extends from the high-tide mark on land to the gently sloping, shallow edge of the continental shelf (the submerged part of the continents). It makes up less than 10% of the world\u2019s ocean area, but it contains 90% of all marine species and is the site of most large commercial marine fisheries. This zone\u2019s aquatic systems include estu-aries, coastal marshes, mangrove forests, and coral reefs.\nAn estuary is where a river meets the sea (Figure \n7.20). It is a partially enclosed body of water where seawa-ter mixes with the river\u2019s freshwater, as well as nutrients and pollutants in runoff from the land.\nEstuaries are associated with coastal wetlands\u2014\ncoastal land areas covered with water all or part of the year. These wetlands, which are some of the earth\u2019s most productive ecosystems (see Figure 3.12, p. 50) include coastal marshes (Figure 7.21) and mangrove forests (Figure 7.22).\n Sea-grass beds (Figure 7.23), another component of \ncoastal marine biodiversity, are underwater ecosystems in shallow coastal waters that host as many as 60 species of grasses and other plants, located along most continental coastlines.\nThese coastal aquatic systems provide important eco-\nsystem and economic services. They help to maintain wa-ter quality in tropical coastal zones by filtering toxic pollutants, excess plant nutrients, and sediments, and by absorbing other pollutants. They provide food, habitats, and nursery sites for a variety of aquatic and terrestrial species. They also reduce storm damage and coastal ero-sion by absorbing waves and storing excess water pro-duced by storms and tsunamis.\nCASE STUDY\nRevisiting Coral Reefs\u2014Amazing Centers \nof Biodiversity\nAs we noted in the Core Case Study, coral reefs (see \nchapter-opening photo) are some of the world\u2019s oldest and most diverse and productive ecosystems. These centers of aquatic biodiversity are the marine equivalents of tropical rain forests, with complex interactions among their diverse populations of species.

The newest growing threat is ocean acidification\u2014 the rising levels of acidity in ocean waters. This is occur -\nring because the oceans absorb about 25% of the CO\n2 \nemitted into the atmosphere by human activities, espe-cially the burning of carbon-containing fossil fuels. The CO\n2 reacts with ocean water to form a weak acid (carbonic \nacid, H 2CO 3). This reaction decreases the levels of carbon-\nate ions (CO 32\u2212) necessary for the formation of coral reefs \nand the shells and skeletons of marine organisms such as crabs, oysters, mussels, and some phytoplankton. This is making it harder for these species to thrive and reproduce, and at some point, this rising acidity could slowly dissolve corals and the shells and skeletons of these marine species.\nOcean acidification and other forms of degradation \ncould have devastating effects on the biodiversity of coral reefs, on the food webs dependent on them, and on the ecosystem services they provide.

They are also aimed at greatly increasing public support for protection of coral reefs and other marine ecosystems.\nThe Open Sea and the Ocean \nFloor Host a Variety of Species\nThe sharp increase in water depth at the edge \nof the continental shelf separates the coastal zone from the vast volume of the ocean called the open sea. This aquatic life zone is divided into three vertical zones (Figure 7.19), or layers, primarily based on the degree of penetration of sunlight. Temperatures also change with depth (Figure 7.19, red line) and we can use them to define zones of varying species diversity in these layers.\nThe euphotic zone is the brightly lit upper \nzone, where drifting phytoplankton carry out about 40% of the world\u2019s photosynthetic activity. Large, fast-swimming predatory fishes such as swordfish, sharks, and bluefin tuna populate the euphotic zone.\nThe bathyal zone is the dimly lit middle \nzone, which receives little sunlight and therefore does not contain photosynthesiz-ing producers. Zooplankton and smaller fishes, many of which migrate to feed on the surface at night, are found in this zone.\nThe deepest zone, called the abyssal zone, \nis dark and very cold. There is no sunlight to support photosynthesis, and this zone has little dissolved oxygen. Nevertheless, the deep ocean floor is teeming with life because it contains enough nutrients to support a large number of species.

A lake\u2019s watershed supplies it with water from rainfall, melt-ing snow, and streams.\nFreshwater lakes vary tremendously in size, depth, and \nnutrient content. Deep lakes normally consist of four dis-tinct zones that are defined by their depth and distance from shore (Figure 7.26).\nEcologists classify lakes according to their nutrient con-\ntent and primary productivity. Lakes that have a small supply of plant nutrients are called oligotrophic lakes. This type of lake (Figure 7.27) is often deep and can have steep banks. Glaciers and mountain streams supply water to many of these lakes, which usually have crystal-clear water and small populations of phytoplankton and fish species, such as smallmouth bass and trout. Because of their low levels of nutrients, these lakes have a low net primary productivity.\nOver time, sediments, organic material, and inorganic \nnutrients wash into most oligotrophic lakes, and plants grow and decompose to form bottom sediments. A lake with a large supply of nutrients is called a eutrophic lake (Figure 7.28). Such lakes typically are shallow and have murky brown or green water. Because of their high levels of nutrients, these lakes have a high net primary productivity.\nHuman inputs of nutrients through the atmosphere \nand from urban and agricultural areas within a lake\u2019s wa-tershed can accelerate the eutrophication of the lake. This process, called cultural eutrophication, often puts ex-cessive nutrients into lakes. Most lakes fall somewhere between the two extremes of nutrient enrichment.\nFIGURE 7.27   Trillium Lake in the U.S. state of Oregon with a view of Mount hood.\ntusharkoley/Shutterstock.com\n90446_ch07_128-159.indd   153 8/13/14   8:36 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Her father and grandfather were legendary underwater explorers who brought the mysteries and wonders of the oceans into living rooms around the world with their films and books.\nThe focus of Alexandra\u2019s work is advocating the importance of conservation and sus-\ntainable management of water in order to preserve a healthy planet. She seeks to make water one of the defining issues of this century, stating: \u201cWe live on a water planet, which means we\u2019re all downstream from one another. Where water comes from, where it goes, and its quality is intricately connected to our quality of life.\u201d\nShe is utilizing tools not even imagined by her grandfather\u2014those of social networking \nand other modes of mobile communication. She believes that environmental advocates can \nuse such new media tools and technology to inform people about how their actions affect our water. For example, she imagines a day in the future when knowing the quality and quantity of our water is as easy as checking the weather on our smart phones.\nAlexandra\u2019s nonprofit Blue Legacy International harnesses technology to tell the stories of our water planet and provides film \nand digital resources to allow others to explore and understand water issues.\nBackground photo: Lisa Heeter | Dreamstime.com\nCourtesy of Alexandra Cousteauindividuals matter 7.1 \nA large number of scientists and other individuals are \ndevoting their lives to understanding aquatic systems and \nlearning how we can use them more sustainably (Indi-viduals Matter 7.1).connect the rivers from their floodplains, destroy aquatic habitats, and alter or degrade the functions of adjoining wetlands.\nThird, cities and farms add pollutants and excess plant \nnutrients to nearby streams, rivers, and lakes. For exam-ple, runoff of nutrients into a lake (cultural eutrophica-tion, Figure 7.28) causes explosions in the populations of algae and cyanobacteria, which deplete the lake\u2019s dis-solved oxygen. Fishes and other species may then die off, which can mean a major loss in biodiversity.\nFourth, many inland wetlands have been drained or \nfilled to grow crops or have been covered with concrete, asphalt, and buildings. More than half of the inland wet-lands estimated to have existed in the continental United States during the 1600s no longer exist. About 80% of these lost wetlands were drained to grow crops. This loss of natural capital has been an important factor in increas-ing flood damage in parts of the United States. Many other countries have suffered similar losses. For example, 80% of all inland wetlands in Germany and France have been destroyed.\n90446_ch07_128-159.indd   156 8/13/14   8:36 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

What are coral reefs and why should we care about \nthem?  What is coral bleaching? What are the major \nthreats to coral reefs?\nSection 7.1\n 2. What is the key concept for this section? Distinguish between weather and climate. Define ocean cur -\nrents. Describe three major factors that determine how air circulates in the lower atmosphere. Explain how varying combinations of temperature and pre-cipitation, along with global air circulation and ocean currents, lead to the formation of various types of forests, grasslands, and deserts.\n 3. Define and give three examples of a greenhouse gas. What is the greenhouse effect and why is it important to the earth\u2019s life and climate? What is the rain shadow effect and how can it lead to the for -\nmation of deserts? Why do cities tend to have more haze and smog, higher temperatures, and lower wind speeds than the surrounding countryside?Section 7.2\n 4. What are the two key concepts for this section? What is a biome? Explain why there are three major types of each of the major biomes (deserts, grass-lands, and forests). Explain why biomes are not uni-form. Describe how climate and vegetation vary with latitude and elevation. What is the edge effect?\n 5. Explain how the three major types of deserts differ in their climate and vegetation. Why are desert ecosys-tems fragile? How do desert plants and animals sur -\nvive? Explain how the three major types of grasslands differ in their climate and vegetation. What is a savanna? Why have many of the world\u2019s temperate grasslands disappeared? What is perma-frost? Explain how the three major types of forests differ in their climate and vegetation. Why is biodi-versity so high in tropical rain forests? Explain why most soils in tropical rain forests hold few plant nu-trients. Why does a thick layer of decaying litter typi-cally cover the floors of temperate deciduous forests? What are coastal coniferous or temperate rain for -\nests? How do most species of coniferous evergreen trees survive the cold winters in boreal forests? What important ecological roles do mountains play?\nThis chapter\u2019s  Core Case Study pointed out the \necological and economic importance of the world\u2019s incredibly \ndiverse coral reefs. They are living examples of the three  \nscientific principles of sustainability in action.  They  \nthrive on solar energy, play key roles in the cycling of carbon and other chemicals, and sustain a great deal of aquatic biodiversity.\nWe also discussed the influence of climate on terrestrial \nbiodiversity in the formation of biomes\u2014deserts, grasslands, and forests\u2014as well as the life forms that live in those sys-tems. These relationships are also in keeping with the three scientific principles of sustainability. The earth\u2019s dynamic climate system helps to distribute heat from solar energy and to recycle the earth\u2019s nutrients. This in turn helps to generate and support the biodiversity found in the earth\u2019s various biomes.\nFinally, we looked at how human activities are degrading \nthe vital ecosystem and economic services that the earth\u2019s ter -\nrestrial and aquatic systems provide. Scientists call for much more research on the components and workings of the world\u2019s terrestrial and aquatic systems, on how they are inter -\nconnected, and on which systems are in the greatest danger of being disrupted by human activities.TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nCoral Reefs and Sustainability\nJonMilnes/Shutterstock.com\n90446_ch07_128-159.indd   157 8/13/14   8:36 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Bees pollinate many flower species and some of our most important food crops, including many vegetables, fruits, and tree nuts such as almonds. European honeybees pol-linate about 71 of the 100 fruit and vegetable crop species that provide 90% of the world\u2019s food and a third of the U.S. food supply.\nMany U.S. growers rent European \nhoneybees from commercial beekeep-ers that truck about 2.7 million hives to farms across the country to polli-nate different crops. Whereas nature relies on the earth\u2019s free pollination service provided by a diversity of bees and other wild pollinators, farmers who practice industrialized agriculture on vast croplands rely mostly on a sin-gle bee species.\nThe problem is that since the \n1980s, European honeybees have been in decline. Since 2006, massive numbers of these bees in the United States and in parts of Europe have been disappearing from their colonies during the winter and not returning as expected in the spring\u2014a phenome-non called colony collapse disorder (CCD). Every winter since 2006, according to the U.S. National Acad-emy of Sciences, about 30% to 40% of the European honeybee colonies in the United States have suffered from CCD, well above the historical loss rates of 10% to 15%.\nSome producers believe we need \nthe industrialized honeybee pollination system in order to grow enough food. \nOthers see such heavy dependence on a single bee species as a potentially dangerous violation of the earth\u2019s bio-diversity principle of sustain-\nability. They argue that this dependence could put food supplies at risk if the European honeybees con-tinue to decline. Also, if this decline leads to smaller harvests, food prices will rise.\nThis is a classic case of how the \ndecline of a species can threaten vital ecosystem and economic services. Sci-entists project that during this century, human activities, especially those that contribute to habitat loss and climate change, are likely to play a key role in the extinction of one-fourth to one-half of the world\u2019s plant and animal species. Many scientists view this threat as one of the most serious and long-lasting environmental and eco-nomic problems we face. In this chap-ter, we discuss the causes of this problem and possible ways to deal with it.Where Have All the Honeybees Gone?\n162 \nDarlyne A.

The extinction of many species in a relatively short period of geologic time is called a mass extinction. Geologic, fossil, and other rec\u00adords indicate that the earth has experienced five mass ex\u00adtinctions, during which 50\u201390% of all species appear to have become extinct (see Supplement 6, p. S49). The third mass extinction, about 250 million years ago, was the worst, with the disappearance of about 90% of the world\u2019s species, including 96% of all marine species. Scientists hypothesize that one of its causes was massive volcanic eruptions over a long time period that released huge amounts of the green\u00adhouse gases CO\n2 and methane (CH 4) into the atmosphere. \nThis caused major and prolonged warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans, along with ocean acidification.\nScientific evidence indicates that after each mass ex\u00ad\ntinction, the earth\u2019s overall biodiversity eventually re\u00adturned to equal or higher levels, but each recovery required several million years. Such long\n\u00adtime recovery is an ex\u00ad\nample of the biodiversity principle of sustainability in action.\nThe causes of past mass extinctions are poorly under \u00ad\nstood but probably involved global changes in environ\u00admental conditions. Examples are sustained and significant global warming or cooling, large changes in sea levels and ocean water acidity, and catastrophes such as multiple large\n\u00adscale volcanic eruptions and large asteroids hitting \nthe planet.\nSome Human Activities Hasten Extinctions \nand Threaten Ecosystem Services\nScientists who study extinction base much of their work on \nan estimated background extinction rate\u2014the rate that existed before modern humans evolved some 200,000 years ago\u2014which scientists estimate was about 1 species per year for every 1 million wild species living on the earth.\nScientific evidence indicates that extinction rates have \nrisen in some areas as human populations have spread over most of the globe, destroying and degrading habitats, consuming huge quantities of resources, and creating large and growing ecological footprints (see Figure 1.10, p. 12). In the words of biodiversity expert Edward O. Wilson (see Individuals Matter 4.1, p. 67), \u201cThe natural world is every\u00adwhere disappearing before our eyes\u2014cut to pieces, mowed down, plowed under, gobbled up, replaced by human artifacts.\u201d\nScientists from around the world who conducted the \n2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimated that the current annual rate of species extinction is at least 100 to 1,000 times the estimated background extinction rate (Science Focus 8.1) (Concept 8.1). We have identified about 2 million species so far, but scientists estimate that there are many millions more. Assuming that there are 10 million species on earth, at the background extinction rate of 1 species per million per year, about 10 species would disappear naturally each year. However, at today\u2019s esti\u00admated rate of 100 to 1,000 times the background rate, we are losing between 1,000 and 10,000 species per year, or between 2 and 27 species every day, on average.\nBiodiversity researchers project that during this cen\u00ad\ntury, the extinction rate is likely to rise to at least 10,000 times the background rate\u2014mostly because of habitat loss and degradation, climate change, ocean acidification, and other environmentally harmful effects of human activities (Concept 8.1).

By the end of this century, most of the big carnivorous cats, including chee\u00adtahs, tigers, and lions, will probably exist only in zoos and small wildlife sanctuaries. And most elephants (see chapter\n\u00adopening photo), rhinoceroses, gorillas, chimpan\u00ad\nzees, and orangutans will likely disappear from the wild.\nSo why is this a big deal? According to biodiversity \nresearchers Edward O. Wilson and Stuart Pimm, at this extinction rate, at least 25% and as many as 50% of the world\u2019s roughly 2 million identified animal and plant spe\u00adcies could vanish from the wild by the end of this century, along with many of the millions of unidentified species. This would amount to a sixth mass extinction caused pri\u00admarily by human activities and taking place within one century (see Supplement 6, p. S49).\nSuch a large\n\u00adscale loss of species would also impair \nsome of the earth\u2019s vital ecosystem services, including air and water purification, natural pest control, and pollination (Core Case Study). According to the 2005 Millennium Eco\u00ad\nsystem Assessment, 15 of 24 of the earth\u2019s major ecosystem services are in decline. If such estimates are only half cor \u00ad\nrect, we can see why many biologists warn that such a massive loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services within the span of a single human lifetime is one of the most im\u00adportant and long\n\u00adlasting environmental and economic \nproblems we face. By saving as many species as possible from extinction\u2014especially keystone species (see p. 69)\u2014we could increase our beneficial environmental impact and help to sustain and enrich our own lives and economies.\n90446_ch08_160-183.indd   163 8/13/14   8:37 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

First,  \nboth the rate of extinction and the resulting threats to eco\u00adsystem services are likely to increase sharply during the next 50\u2013100 years because of the harmful environmental impacts of the rapidly growing human population and its growing per capita use of resources (see Table 1.1, p. 13).\nSecond, the current and projected extinction rates in the \nworld\u2019s biodiversity hotspots\u2014areas that are highly endan\u00ad\ngered centers of biodiversity\u2014are much higher than the global average. Degradation of these hotspot areas affects many more species than do human activities in already degraded areas.\nThird, we are eliminating, degrading, fragmenting, and \nsimplifying many biologically diverse environments\u2014\n \nincluding tropical forests, coral reefs, wetlands, and \n estuaries\u2014that serve as potential sites for the emergence of new species. Thus, in addition to greatly increasing the rate of extinction, we may be limiting the long\n\u00adterm re\u00ad\ncovery of biodiversity by eliminating these places where new species can evolve. In other words, we are also creat\u00ading a speciation crisis. (See the online Guest Essay by Nor \u00ad\nman Myers on this topic.)\nBiologists Philip Levin, Donald Levin, and others warn \nthat, while our activities are likely to reduce the speciation rates for some species, they might increase the speciation rates for other rapidly reproducing species such as weeds and rats, as well as cockroaches and many other species of insects. Rapidly expanding populations of such species could crowd and compete with various other species, fur \u00ad\nther accelerating their extinction and also threatening key ecosystem services.\nEndangered and Threatened Species Are \nEcological Smoke Alarms\nBiologists classify species that are heading toward biologi\u00ad\ncal extinction as either endangered or threatened. An en-dangered species has so few individual survivors that the species could soon become extinct. A threatened species, such as the cheetah or the loggerhead sea turtle, \nScientists who try to catalog extinc-\ntions, estimate past extinction rates, \nand project future extinction rates face three problems. First, because the nat-ural extinction of a species typically takes a very long time, it is difficult to document. Second, we have identified \nonly about 2 million of the world\u2019s esti-mated 7\u201310 million and perhaps as many as 100 million species. Third, sci-entists know little about the ecological roles of most of the species that have been identified.\nOne approach to estimating future \nextinction rates is to study records doc-umenting past rates at which easily ob-servable mammals and birds have become extinct. Most of these extinc-tions have occurred since humans be-gan to dominate the planet about 10,000 years ago, when we began the shift from hunting and gathering food in the wild to growing our food and living in towns and cities. This informa-tion can be compared with fossil rec\n-\nords of extinctions that occurred before that time.\nAnother approach is to observe how \nreductions in habitat area affect extinc-tion rates. The species\u2013area relation-ship, studied by Edward O. Wilson  \n(see Individuals Matter 4.1, p. 67) and \nrobert MacArthur, suggests that, on \naverage, a 90% loss of land habitat in a given area can cause the extinction of about 50% of the species living in that area. Thus we can base extinction rate estimates on the rates of habitat destruction and degradation, which is increasing around the world.\nScientists also use mathematical \nmodels to estimate the risk of a partic-ular species becoming endangered or", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3819, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ad43518-ea62-4b86-9714-0bbe203b72d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ad43518-ea62-4b86-9714-0bbe203b72d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "G.

Without urgent protective action, the endangered orangutan may disap\u00adpear in the wild within the next two decades.\nCheryl Knott\u2014a biological anthropologist, National \nGeographic Emerging Explorer, and Associate Professor of Anthropology at Boston University\u2014has been studying endangered orangutans in a national park in Borneo. Her research goals are to understand how fluctuations in food availability in the orangutan\u2019s environment have shaped their behavioral and physiological adaptations and how this can help us better understand human evolutionary history.\nDoes it matter that orangutans might soon become \nextinct largely due to human activities, or that some un\u00adknown insect or plant species may meet the same fate? New species eventually evolve to take the places of those species lost through mass extinctions, so why should we care if we greatly speed up the extinction rate over the next 50\u2013100 years? According to biologists, there are three major reasons why we should work to prevent our activi\u00adties from causing or hastening the extinction of other species.First, the world\u2019s species provide vital ecosystem services \n(see Figure 1.3, p. 7) that help to keep us alive and support our economies (Concept 8.2). For example, we depend on honeybees (Core Case Study) and other insects for pollina\u00adtion of many food crops and on certain species of birds, amphibians (see Chapter 4, Core Case Study, p. 64), and spiders for natural control of insect pests.\n By eliminating a \nspecies or sharply reducing its population, especially a spe\u00adcies that plays a keystone role (see p. 69), we can speed up the extinction of other species.\n This can upset an ecosys\u00ad\ntem and degrade its important ecosystem services.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Species and Ecosystem Services\nPlant and animal species provide us with services in ways that you might not \nexpect. For example, those that live in streams help to purify the flowing water. Trees and other forest plants produce oxygen, without which we could not sur -\nvive. And earthworms aerate topsoil that we use for growing our food. These are vital ecosystem services, provided free of charge.\nA second major reason for preventing extinctions caused \nor hastened by human activities is that many species also \ncontribute to economic services on which we depend (Con-cept 8.2). Various plant species provide economic value as food crops, fuelwood, lumber, and paper from trees, and useful scientific knowledge. To biologist Edward O. Wil\u00adson, carelessly and rapidly eliminating species that make up an essential part of the world\u2019s biodiversity is like burn\u00ading millions of books that we have never read.\nFIGURE 8.4   Natural capital degra-\ndation: These endangered orang-\nutans depend on a rapidly disappearing tropical forest habitat in Borneo.

Ac\u00adcording to a United Nations University report, 62% of all cancer drugs were derived from the discoveries of bio\u00adprospectors. Despite their economic and medicinal poten\u00adtial, less than 0.5% of the world\u2019s known plant species have been examined for their medicinal properties. \nGREEN \nCAREER:  Bioprospecting\nAnother economic benefit that can be gained through \npreserving species and their habitats is the revenues from ecotourism, which generates more than $1 million per min\u00adute in tourist expenditures, worldwide. Conservation bi\u00adologist Michael Soul\u00e9 estimates that a male lion living to age 7 generates about $515,000 through ecotourism in Kenya, but only about $10,000 if it is killed for its skin.\nA third major reason for not hastening extinctions \nthrough our activities is that a sharp reduction in biodi\u00adversity will hinder speciation. Analysis of past mass ex\u00adtinctions indicates it will take 5 million to 10 million years for natural speciation to rebuild the biodiversity that is likely to be lost during this century as a result of human activities.\nFourth, many people believe that wild species have a \nright to exist, regardless of their usefulness to us (Concept 8.2). According to this worldview, we have an ethical re\u00adsponsibility to protect the earth\u2019s species from becoming extinct as a result of our activities, and to prevent the deg\u00adradation of the world\u2019s ecosystem services that are vital to our life\n\u00adsupport system and economies.\n8.3 HOW DO HUMANS ACCELERATE \nSPECIES EXTINCTION AND DEGRADATION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES?\nCONCEPT 8.3   The greatest threats to species and ecosys-\ntem services are (in order) loss or degradation of habitat, \nharmful invasive species, human population growth, pollu-tion, climate change, and overexploitation.\nLoss of Habitat Is the Single Greatest \nThreat to Species: Remember HIPPCO\nBiodiversity researchers summarize the most important \ndirect causes of extinction and threats to ecosystem ser \u00ad\nvices using the acronym HIPPCO: Habitat destruction, \ndegradation, and fragmentation; I nvasive (nonnative) \nspecies; Population growth and increasing use of re\u00ad\nsources; Pollution; Climate change; and O verexploitation \n(Concept 8.3).\nAccording to biodiversity researchers, the greatest threat \nto wild species is habitat loss (Figure 8.5), degradation, and fragmentation. Specifically, deforestation in tropical areas (see Figure 3.1, p. 42) is the greatest threat to species and to the ecosystem services they provide, followed by the destruction and degradation of coastal wetlands and coral reefs (see Chapter 7, Core Case Study, p. 130), the plowing of grasslands for planting of crops (see Figure 7.13, p. 141), and the pollution of streams, lakes, and oceans.\nIsland species\u2014many of them found nowhere else on \nearth\u2014are especially vulnerable to extinction when their habitats are destroyed, degraded, or fragmented, because they have nowhere else to go. This is why the collection of islands that make up the U.S. state of Hawaii is America\u2019s \u201cextinction capital\u201d\u2014with 63% of its species at risk.\nHabitat fragmentation occurs when a large, intact \narea of habitat such as a forest or natural grassland is di\u00advided, typically by roads, logging operations, crop fields, and urban development, into smaller, isolated patches or habitat islands.

It can also divide popu\u00adlations of a species into increasingly isolated small groups that are more vulnerable to predators, competitor species, disease, and catastrophic events such as storms and fires. In addition, habitat fragmentation creates barriers that limit the abilities of some species to disperse and colonize areas, to locate adequate food supplies, and to find mates.\nWe Have Moved Disruptive Species into \nSome Ecosystems\nAfter habitat loss and degradation, the next biggest cause \nof animal and plant extinctions and loss of the ecosystem services they provide is the deliberate or accidental intro\u00adduction of harmful species into ecosystems (Concept 8.3).\nMany introductions of nonnative species have been \nbeneficial to us. According to a study by ecologist David Pimentel, nonnative species such as corn, wheat, rice, and other food crops, as well as some species of cattle, poultry, and other livestock, provide more than 98% of the U.S. food supply. Similarly, nonnative tree spe\u00adcies are grown in about 85% of the world\u2019s tree planta\u00adtions. Some deliberately introduced species have also helped to control pests. In the 1600s English settlers brought highly beneficial European honeybees (Core Case Study) to North America to provide honey and we now use them to pollinate most major crops.\nThe problem is that, in their new habitats, some intro\u00ad\nduced species do not face the natural predators, competi\u00adtors, parasites, viruses, bacteria, or fungi that had helped to control their numbers in their original habitats. This can allow such nonnative species to crowd out populations of many native species, disrupt ecosystem services, cause hu\u00adman health problems, and lead to economic losses.\nFigure 8.6 shows some of the 7,100 or more invasive \nspecies that, after being deliberately or accidentally intro\u00adduced into the United States, have caused ecological and economic harm.

About a million of these snakes, imported from Africa and Asia, have been sold as pets. Some buyers, after learning that these reptiles do not make good pets, have dumped them into the wetlands of the Everglades.\nThe Burmese python (Figure 8.7) can live 20\u201325 years, \ngrowing as long as 5 meters (16 feet). It can weigh as much 77 kilograms (170 pounds) and be as big around as a telephone pole. Pythons are hard to find and kill and they reproduce rapidly. They have huge appetites and feed at night, eating a variety of birds and mammals (such as rabbits, foxes, raccoons, and white\n\u00adtailed deer) and occa\u00ad\nsionally other reptiles, including the American alligator\u2014 a keystone species in the Everglades ecosystem (see Chap\u00adter 4, Case Study, p. 64).\n They seize their prey with their sharp teeth, wrap themselves around the prey, and squeeze them to death before feeding on them. They have also been known to eat pet cats and dogs, small farm animals, and geese. Research indicates that predation by these snakes is altering the complex food webs and ecosystem services of the Everglades.\nResearchers say that the Burmese python population \nin Florida\u2019s wetlands cannot be controlled. In 2014, re\u00adsearchers Shannon Pittman and Kristen Hart found that trapping and moving the snakes from one area to another is not a viable control strategy because the snakes have the ability to return to the areas where they were captured. Some researchers warn that the Burmese python could spread to other swampy wetlands in the southern half of the United States.\nSome invasive species, such as kudzu (Figure 8.6), have \nbeen deliberately introduced into ecosystems.

It has displaced other mussel species and depleted the food sup\u00adply for some native aquatic species. The mussels have also caused massive economic damages by clogging irrigation pipes, shutting down cooling water intake pipes for power plants and city water supplies, jamming ship rudders, and growing in large masses on boat hulls, piers, and other exposed aquatic surfaces.\n90446_ch08_160-183.indd   170 8/13/14   8:37 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

People have \neliminated, degraded, and fragmented vast areas of wild\u00adlife habitat as they have spread out all over the planet, using resources at increasing rates wherever they go (Fig\u00adure 8.5), and this has caused the extinction of many spe\u00adcies (Concept 8.3).\nPollution also threatens some species with extinction, \nas has been shown by the unintended effects of certain pesticides. According to the USFWS, each year, pesticides kill about one\n\u00adfifth of the European honeybee colonies \nthat pollinate almost a third of all U.S. food crops (Core Case Study and Science Focus 8.2). The USFWS estimates that pesticides also kill more than 67 million birds and 6\u201314 million fish each year, and they threaten about 20% of the country\u2019s endangered and threatened species.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, populations of fish\n\u00adeating \nbirds such as ospreys, brown pelicans, and bald eagles plummeted. The concentration of a chemical derived from the pesticide DDT was magnified as it moved up through their food web (Figure 8.9). The chemical made these top predator birds\u2019 eggshells so fragile that they could not re\u00adproduce successfully. Also hard hit in those years were predatory birds such as the prairie falcon, sparrow hawk, and peregrine falcon, which help to control populations of rabbits, ground squirrels, and other crop eaters. Since the U.S. ban on DDT in 1972, most of these bird species have made a comeback.\nAccording to a study by Conservation International, \nprojected climate change could help to drive a quarter to half \nof all land animals and plants to extinction by the end of this century. For example, scientific studies indicate that the polar bear is threatened because of higher temperatures and melting sea ice in its polar habitat. The shrinkage of floating ice is making it harder for polar bears to find prey such as seals, which use the ice as a platform for diving to find food and to give birth to their pups (Figure 8.10). Ac\u00adcording to the IUCN, the world\u2019s total polar bear popula\u00adtion is likely to decline by 30\u201335% by 2050. By the end of this century, polar bears might be found only in zoos.\nThe Illegal Killing, Capturing, and Selling \nof Wild Species Threatens Biodiversity\nSome protected species are illegally killed (poached) for \ntheir valuable parts or are sold live to collectors.

This problem also occurs in parts of Eu-rope, China, and India.\nScientific research has found a num-\nber of possible of reasons for this de-cline, including:\n\u2022\tThe\n\tvarroa mite, a parasitic insect, can \nweaken and kill honeybee adults by \nfeeding on their blood and larvae. It has killed millions of bees since it ap-peared in the U.S. in 1987\u2014probably from infected bees imported from South America.\n\u2022\tHarmful interactions between viruses and fungi found in European hon-eybees and in almost all bee colo-nies suffering from colony collapse \n disorder can kill bees by weakening their immune systems.\n\u2022\tPesticides. As honeybees forage for nectar, they can come into contact with insec-ticides that they sometimes carry back to their hives. Some research indicates that several types of widely used neonicotinoids, which are derived from nicotine that to-bacco plants use as a natural insecticide, may play a role in CCD. These pesticides are deliberately incorporated into food plants so they end up in the nectar and pollen that the bees take back to their colonies. Some studies sug-gest that exposure to trace amounts of these chemicals can disrupt the nervous systems of bees, decrease their ability to find their way back to their hives, weaken their immune systems, and make them more susceptible to mites, viruses, and fungi. The explosive growth in the use of neonicotinoids since 2005 has roughly tracked the rise in CCD since 2006. \npesticide manufacturers deny \nthat the levels of neonicotinoids and other pesticides that bees are exposed to are high enough to cause harm if the chemicals are used as directed.\n\u2022\tStress and poor nutrition, for some of the bees that are transported long distances around the United States for the industrial pollination business (Figure 8.A), can weaken the bees\u2019 immune systems and make them more vulnerable to death due to mites, viruses, fungi, and pesticides.\u2022\tLack of natural foraging areas. Wide-spread conversion of grasslands to crop fields has dramatically reduced the diversity of natural plants on which bees naturally thrive.\nThe growing consensus among bee \nresearchers is that the likely cause of colony collapse disorder is a combina-tion of the often-interacting factors listed here. Some scientists see the de-cline of honeybees as an indicator of the environmental degradation of our life-support system.\nCritical Thinking\nCan you think of some ways in which commercial beekeepers could lessen one or more of the threats described here? Explain.\nFIGURE 8.A   European honeybee hive boxes in an acacia orchard.

A single poached black rhinoceros horn (Figure 8.11) can be worth as much as $500,000 by the time it reaches the black market in Asia.

The two ivory tusks on an adult male elephant can be worth $375,000 on the black market. In 2013, according to WildAid, elephants were being killed for their ivory at a rate of about 30,000 per year, or one about every 17 minutes, on average. China has the largest market for illegal ivory, followed by the United States.\nIn 2014, researchers were testing the use of small aerial \ndrones to find illegal poachers during the night by detecting the presence of their weapons.

Today there are about 3,200, half of them in In\u00addia. This is mostly due to a 90% loss of habitat, caused by rapid human population growth, and poaching, much of which is motivated by poverty. The Indian, or Bengal, tiger is at risk because a coat made from its fur can sell for as much as $100,000 in Tokyo. The bones and penis of a single tiger can fetch as much as $70,000 in China, the world\u2019s biggest market for such illegal items. According to the World Wildlife Fund, without emergency action to curtail poaching and preserve tiger habitat, few if any ti\u00adgers, including the Sumatran tiger (Figure 8.2d), will be left in the wild by 2022.\nIn India, conservation biologist and National Geo\u00ad\ngraphic Emerging Explorer Krithi Karanth is studying conflicts between the rapidly growing number of humans and the declining populations of wildlife such as tigers and Asian elephants. As habitat for these animals shrinks, they damage farmers\u2019 crops while trying to feed themselves. Karanth has visited more than 8,000 villages in India, and also involves 500 \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d to help her interview villagers and collect data.

List two steps you could take to help protect the world\u2019s remaining wild \ntigers from extinction.\nAround the globe, the legal and illegal trade in wild \nspecies for use as pets is a huge and very profitable busi\u00ad\nness. Many owners of wild pets do not know that, for ev\u00adery live animal captured and sold in the pet market, many others are killed or die in transit. According to the IUCN, more than 60 bird species, mostly parrots, are endangered or threatened because of the wild bird trade (see the Case Study that follows).\nBuyers of wild animals might also be unaware that \nsome imported exotic animals carry diseases such as Hantavirus, Ebola virus, Asian bird flu, herpes B virus (carried by most adult macaques), and salmonella (from pets such as hamsters, turtles, and iguanas). These diseases can spread quite easily from pets to their owners and then to other people.\nOther wild species whose populations are depleted \nbecause of the pet trade include many amphibians (see Chapter 4, Core Case Study, p. 64), various reptiles, and tropical fishes taken mostly from the coral reefs of Indone\u00adsia and the Philippines.\n Some divers catch tropical fish by \nusing plastic squeeze bottles of poisonous cyanide to stun them. For each fish caught alive, many more die. In addi\u00adtion, the cyanide solution kills the polyps, the tiny animals that create the reef.\nSome exotic plants, especially orchids and cacti (see Fig\u00ad\nure 7.11, center, p. 138), are endangered because they are gathered, often illegally, and sold to collectors to decorate houses, offices, and landscapes. A mature crested saguaro cactus can earn a cactus rustler as much as $15,000, and an orchid collector might pay $5,000 for a single rare orchid.\nAccording to the USFWS, collectors of exotic birds \nmight pay $10,000 or more for an endangered hyacinth macaw smuggled out of Brazil. However, during its life\u00adtime, a single hyacinth macaw left in the wild could attract an estimated $165,000 in ecotourism revenues.\nA Rising Demand for Bushmeat Threatens \nSome African Species\nFor centuries, indigenous people in much of West and \nCentral Africa have sustainably hunted wildlife for bush-meat as a source of food. But in the last three decades, bushmeat hunting in some areas has skyrocketed as hunt\u00aders have tried to provide food for rapidly growing popula\u00adtions or to make a living by supplying restaurants in major cities with exotic meats from gorillas (Figure 8.12) and other species. Logging roads in once\n\u00adinaccessible forests \nhave made such hunting much easier.\nBushmeat hunting has driven at least one species\u2014\nMiss Waldron\u2019s red colobus monkey\u2014to complete extinc\u00adtion. It is also a factor in the reduction of some populations \nFIGURE 8.11   A poacher in \nSouth Africa killed this critically \nendangered northern white rhi-noceros for its two horns.

According to the IUCN 2013 Red List of Endan\u00adgered Species, roughly one of every eight (13%) of all bird species is threatened with extinction mostly by habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation (the H in HIPPCO)\u2014primarily in tropical forests.\nAccording to a 2011 study, State of the Birds, almost \none\n\u00adthird of the more than 800 bird species in the United \nStates are endangered (Figure 8.2b and c), threatened, or in decline, mostly because of habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, and climate change. Sharp declines in bird populations have occurred among songbird species that migrate long distances. These birds nest deep in North American woods in the summer and spend their winters in Central or South America or on the Caribbean Islands. The primary causes of these population declines appear to be habitat loss and fragmentation of the birds\u2019 breeding habitats in North America and Central and South America. In addition, the populations of 40% of the world\u2019s water birds are in decline because of the global loss of wetlands.\nAfter habitat loss, the intentional or accidental intro\u00ad\nduction of nonnative species such as bird\n\u00adeating rats is the \nsecond greatest danger, affecting about 28% of the world\u2019s threatened birds. Other such invasive species (the I in \n HIPPCO) include snakes (such as the brown tree snake) and mongooses. In the United States, feral cats and pet cats kill at least 1.4 billion birds each year, according to a 2012 study by Peter Mara of the Smithsonian Conserva\u00adtion Biology Institute.\nPopulation growth, the first P in HIPPCO, also threat\u00ad\nens some bird species, as more people spread out over the landscape each year, increasing their use of timber, food, and other resources, which results in destruction or distur \u00ad\nbance of bird habitats. Pollution, the second P in HIPPCO, is another major threat to birds. Countless birds are ex\u00adposed to oil spills, insecticides, herbicides, and toxic lead from shotgun pellets that fall into wetlands and from lead sinkers left by anglers. (However, the use of lead in shot\u00adgun pellets and sinkers is being phased out.)\nAnother rapidly growing threat to birds is climate \nchange, the C in HIPPCO. A study done for the WWF found that the effects of climate change, such as heat waves and flooding, are causing declines of some bird populations in every part of the globe. Such losses are ex\u00adpected to increase sharply during this century.\nOverexploitation (the O in HIPPCO) is also a major \nthreat to bird populations. Fifty\n\u00adtwo of the world\u2019s 388 \nparrot species are threatened, partly because so many par \u00ad\nrots are captured (often illegally) for sale as pets, usually to \nFIGURE 8.12   Bushmeat such as this sev-\nered head of an endangered lowland gorilla \nin the Congo is consumed as a source of protein by local people in parts of West and Central Africa and is sold in national and in-ternational marketplaces and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3705, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59857f62-d5a8-45b4-be69-502cbf7702f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "59857f62-d5a8-45b4-be69-502cbf7702f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "G.

At least 23 species \nof seabirds face extinction, largely due to the harmful ef\u00adfects of industrialized fishing. For example, many diving birds drown after becoming hooked on baited lines or trapped in huge nets that are set out by fishing boats.\nBiodiversity scientists view this decline of bird species \nwith alarm. One reason is that birds are excellent indicator species because they live in every climate and biome, re\u00adspond quickly to environmental changes in their habitats, and are relatively easy to track and count. To these scien\u00adtists, the decline of many bird species indicates widespread environmental degradation.\nA second reason for alarm is that birds perform criti\u00ad\ncally important economic and ecosystem services through\u00adout the world. For example, many birds play specialized roles in pollination and seed dispersal, especially in tropi\u00adcal areas, so extinctions of these bird species could lead to extinctions of plants that depend on the birds for pollina\u00adtion. Then, some specialized animals that feed mostly on these plants might also become extinct. Such a cascade of extinctions, in turn, could affect our own food supplies and well\n\u00adbeing. Biodiversity scientists (Individuals Matter 8.1) \nurge us to listen more carefully to what birds are telling us about the state of the environment, for the birds\u2019 sake, as well as for ours.8.4 HOW CAN WE SUSTAIN WILD \nSPECIES AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE?\nCONCEPT 8.4   We can reduce species extinction and sus-\ntain ecosystem services by establishing and enforcing na-\ntional environmental laws and international treaties and by creating and protecting wildlife sanctuaries.\nInternational Treaties and National Laws \nCan Help to Protect Species\nSome countries have strong laws that help to sustain wild \nspecies and ecosystem services (see the Case Study that follows). Several international treaties and conventions also help to protect endangered and threatened wild spe\u00adcies (Concept 8.4).\nOne of the most far reaching of international agree\u00ad\nments is the 1975 Convention on International Trade in Endan-gered Species (CITES). This treaty, signed by 178 countries, bans the hunting, capturing, and selling of threatened or endangered species. It lists 926 species that are in danger of extinction and that cannot be commercially traded as live \nindividuals matter 8.1 \n\u00c7ag \u02d8 an Hakk\u0131 S \u00b8 ekerciog \u02d8 lu: Protector of Birds and National \nGeographic Emerging Explorer\n\u00c7ag \u02d8 an S \u00b8 ekerciog \u02d8 lu, assistant professor in the University of Utah Department of Biology, \nis a bird expert, a tropical biologist, an accomplished wildlife photographer, and a Na-tional Geographic Emerging Explorer.

It restricts the inter \u00ad\nnational trade of roughly 5,000 animal species and 29,000 \nplant species that are at risk of becoming threatened.\nCITES has helped to reduce the international trade of \nmany threatened animals, including elephants (see chapter \u00ad\nopening photo), crocodiles, cheetahs, and chimpanzees. But the effects of this treaty are limited because enforcement varies from country to country, and convicted violators often pay only small fines. Also, member countries can exempt themselves from protecting any listed species, and much of the highly profitable illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products goes on in countries that have not signed the treaty.\nAnother important treaty is the Convention on Biological \nDiversity (CBD), ratified or accepted by 193 countries (but as of 2014, not by the United States). It legally commits participating governments to reducing the global rate of biodiversity loss and to equitably sharing the benefits from use of the world\u2019s genetic resources. This includes efforts to prevent or control the spread of ecologically harmful invasive species.\nThis convention is a landmark in international law be\u00ad\ncause it focuses on ecosystems rather than on individual spe\u00adcies, and it links biodiversity protection to issues such as the traditional rights of indigenous peoples. However, because some key countries, including the United States, have not ratified it, implementation has been slow. Also, the law con\u00adtains no severe penalties or other enforcement mechanisms.\nCASE STUDY\nThe U.S. Endangered Species Act\nThe Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA; amended in 1982, \n1985, and 1988) was designed to identify and protect en\u00addangered species in the United States and abroad (Con-cept 8.4). This act is probably the most successful and far\n\u00adreaching environmental law adopted by any nation, \nwhich has made it controversial.\nUnder the ESA, the National Marine Fisheries Service \n(NMFS) is responsible for identifying and listing endan\u00adgered and threatened ocean species, while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is to identify and list all other endangered and threatened species. Any decision by either agency to list or delist a species must be based on biological factors alone, without consideration of economic or political factors. However, the two agencies can use eco\u00adnomic factors in deciding whether and how to protect en\u00addangered habitat and in developing recovery plans for listed species. The ESA also forbids federal agencies (except the Defense Department) to carry out, fund, or authorize projects that would jeopardize any endangered or threat\u00adened species or destroy or modify its critical habitat.\nFor offenses committed on private lands, fines as high as \n$100,000 and 1 year in prison can be imposed to ensure protection of the habitats of endangered species. Although this provision has rarely been used, it has been controversial because at least 90% of the listed species live totally or par \u00ad\ntially on private land. Since 1982, the ESA has been amended to give private landowners various economic incentives to help save endangered species living on their lands. The ESA also makes it illegal for Americans to sell or buy any product made from an endangered or threatened species or to hunt, kill, collect, or injure such species in the United States.\nBetween 1973 and April 2014, the number of U.S. spe\u00ad\ncies on the official endangered and threatened species lists increased from 92 to 1,524. According to a study by the Nature Conservancy, about 33% of the country\u2019s species are at risk of extinction, and 15% of all species are at high risk\u2014far more than the current number listed.\nAll seven species of sea turtles are classified as critically \nendangered or threatened under the ESA.

Each year, tens of millions of wild animals are also brought in ille\u00adgally, but few illegal shipments of endangered or threat\u00adened animals or plants are confiscated.\nSince 1995, there have been numerous efforts to \nweaken the ESA and to reduce its already meager annual budget. Opponents of the act contend that it puts the rights and welfare of endangered plants and animals above those of people. Some critics would do away with this act.

First, species are listed only when they face serious danger of extinction. ESA supporters argue that this is similar to a hospital emer \u00ad\ngency room set up to take only the most desperate cases, often with little hope for recovery. Such a facility could not be expected to save all or even most of its patients.\nSecond, according to federal data, the conditions of \nmore than half of the listed species are stable or improv\u00ading, 90% are recovering at rates specified by their recovery plans, and 99% of the protected species are still surviving. A hospital emergency room having similar results would be considered to be an astounding success story.\nThird, it takes many decades for a species to reach the \npoint where it is in danger of extinction. Thus, it takes many decades to bring a species back to the point where it can be removed from the endangered list.\nFourth, the 2013 budget for protecting endangered spe\u00ad\ncies amounted to an average expenditure of about 61 cents per U.S. citizen, and the budget has not increased significantly since then. To ESA supporters, it is amazing that the federal agencies responsible for enforcing the act have managed to stabilize or improve the conditions of 99% of the listed species on such a small budget.A national poll conducted by the CBD found that two \nout of three Americans want the ESA strengthened or left alone. However, in 2014, some members of Congress were attempting to gut the law by supporting legislation that would (1) require state and congressional approval for adding any new species to the protected list, which would essentially make it impossible to list a new species, (2) automatically delist any species after 5 years\u2014a way to phase out this popular law without voting to repeal it, and (3) allow state governors to decide whether and how \ntheir states would obey ESA regulations.\nSome ESA supporters agree that the act can be im\u00ad\nproved. They cite a U.S. National Academy of Sciences study that recommended three major changes in the way the law is being implemented, in order to make it more scientifically sound and effective:\n\u2022\t Greatly\n\tincrease\tthe\tmeager\tfunding\tfor\timplementing \t\nthe act.\n\u2022\t Put\tgreater\temphasis \ton\tdeveloping \trecovery \tplans\t\nmore quickly.\n\u2022\t When \ta\tspecies\tis\tfirst\tlisted,\testablish \tthe\tcore\tof\tits\t\nhabitat as critical for its survival and give that area the \nmaximum protection.\nOther suggestions include providing more technical \nand financial assistance to landowners who want to help \nprotect endangered species on their property. At least 80% of the habitat for about half of the protected species is on privately owned land.\nFishing nets entangle and \nkill many sea turtles.\nFIGURE 8.13   This endangered green sea turtle died after being caught in a fishing net.\nMark Foley/State Archives of Florida, Florida Memory\n90446_ch08_160-183.indd   178 8/13/14   8:37 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This approach worked well. In 2009, the brown pelican was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list. By 2013, there were more than 560 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System. Each year, more than 47 million Americans visit these refuges to hunt, fish, hike, and watch birds and other wildlife.\nMore than three\n\u00adfourths of the refuges serve as wet\u00ad\nland sanctuaries that are vital for protecting migratory waterfowl. At least one\n\u00adfourth of all U.S. endangered and \nthreatened species have habitats in the refuge system, and some refuges have been set aside specifically for certain endangered species (Concept 8.4). Such areas have helped Florida\u2019s key deer, the brown pelican, and the trumpeter swan to recover.\nThere is also bad news about the U.S. refuge system. \nAccording to a General Accounting Office study, activities that are harmful to wildlife, such as mining, oil drilling, and use of off\n\u00adroad vehicles, take place in nearly 60% of the na\u00ad\ntion\u2019s wildlife refuges. Biodiversity researchers urge the U.S. government to set aside more refuges and to increase the long\n\u00adunderfunded budget for the refuge system.\nElsewhere in the world, reserves and refuges have also \nbeen successful, and public awareness has played a big role in their success. Dereck and Beverly Joubert are National Geographic Explorers and award\n\u00adwinning filmmakers \nwho, for more than 30 years, have been studying, filming, and writing about threatened lions, leopards, and chee\u00adtahs, and other big\n\u00adcat predators in Africa, hoping to \nheighten public awareness of the plight of these ani\u00admals. Their efforts have contributed to the establishment of protected reserves for big cats and other African wildlife in Botswana, Tanzania, and Kenya.\nNational Geographic is funding several other efforts to \npreserve wild species, including that of Maia Raymundo, who is studying a critically endangered species of fruit bat in the Philippines, threatened by hunting and high rates of deforestation. Conservation biologists are alarmed about the steep decline of many bat species. Some populations of these fruit bats have declined by as much as 98% in large areas of their range. Raymundo\u2019s goal is to identify and protect critical habitat areas for the endangered bats.\nSeed Banks, Botanical Gardens, and \nWildlife Farms Can Help to Protect Species\nWe can use seed banks to preserve genetic information and \nendangered plant species, storing their seeds in refrigerated, low\n\u00adhumidity environments. More than 1,000 seed banks \naround the world collectively hold about 3 million samples.GOOD\nNEWS\nGOODNEWSSome species cannot be preserved in seed banks, \nwhich vary in quality, are expensive to operate, and are \nvulnerable to destruction by fire or other mishaps.

Captive breeding has been used to save the pere\u00adgrine falcon and the California condor (Figure 8.2b).\nOther techniques for increasing the populations of cap\u00ad\ntive species include artificial insemination, embryo trans\u00adfer (surgical implantation of eggs of one species into a surrogate mother of another species), use of incubators, and cross fostering (in which the young of a rare species are raised by parents of a similar species). Scientists also match individuals for mating by using DNA analysis along with computer databases that hold information on family lineages of endangered zoo animals\u2014a computer dating service for zoo animals.\nThe ultimate goal of captive breeding programs is to \nbuild populations to a level where they can be reintroduced into the wild. Successes include the black\n\u00adfooted ferret, the \ngolden lion tamarin (a highly endangered monkey species), the Arabian oryx, and the California condor (Figure 8.2b). However, most reintroductions fail because of a lack of suit\u00adable habitat, an inability of the individuals bred in captivity to survive in the wild, renewed overhunting or poaching, or pollution and other hazards in the environment.\nOne problem for captive breeding programs is that a \ncaptive population of an endangered species must typically number 100\u2013500 individuals in order to avoid extinction resulting from accidents, diseases, or the loss of genetic diversity through inbreeding. Recent genetic research in\u00addicates that 10,000 or more individuals are needed for an endangered species to maintain its capacity for biological evolution. Zoos and research centers do not have the funding or space to house such large populations.\nPublic aquariums that exhibit unusual and attractive \nspecies of fish and marine animals such as seals and dol\u00adphins help to educate the public about the need to protect such species. However, mostly because of limited funds, public aquariums have not served as effective gene banks for endangered marine species, especially marine mam\u00admals that need large volumes of water.Efforts to Protect Species Raise Difficult \nQuestions\nEfforts to prevent the extinction of wild species and the \naccompanying losses of ecosystem services require the use of financial and human resources that are limited.

One of the key reasons for such problems is that most people are simply unaware of the highly valuable ecosystem and economic ser -\nvices provided by the earth\u2019s species.\nIn keeping with two of the three scientific princi-\nples of sustainability, by acting to prevent the extinc-\ntion of species as a result of human activities, we would be helping to pre-serve not only the earth\u2019s biodiversity, but also the vital ecosystem services that sus-tain us, including chemical cycling. And it is not only for these species that we ought to act, but also for the long-term health and well-being of our own species in keeping with two of the three social science principles of sustainability (see Supplement 7, p. S51).TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nHoneybees and Sustainability\nMalwina Szweda/Shutterstock.com\nSection 8.2\n 3. What is the key concept for this section?

An old-growth forest, or pri-mary forest, is an uncut or regenerated forest that has not been seriously disturbed by human activities or natu-ral disasters for 200 years or more (Figure 9.2). Old-growth forests are reservoirs of biodiversity because they provide ecological niches for a multitude of wildlife species (see Figure 7.15, p. 143).\nA second-growth forest is a stand of trees resulting \nfrom secondary ecological succession (see Figure 5.8,  \np. 91). These forests develop after the trees in an area have been removed by human activities, such as clear-cutting for timber or conversion to cropland, or by natural forces such as fires and hurricanes.\nA tree plantation, also called a tree farm or com-\nmercial forest (Figure 9.3), is a managed forest contain-ing only one or two species of trees that are all of the same age. They are often grown on land that was cleared of an old-growth or second-growth forest and are usually har -\nvested by clear-cutting as soon as they become commer -\ncially valuable. The land is then replanted and clear-cut again in a regular cycle. When managed carefully, such plantations can produce wood at a rapid rate and could supply most of the wood used for industrial purposes, in-cluding papermaking. This would help to protect the world\u2019s remaining old-growth and second-growth forests, as long as they are not cleared to make room for tree plantations.\nThe downside of tree plantations is that, with only one \nor two tree species, they are much less biologically diverse and less sustainable than old-growth and second-growth forests because they violate nature\u2019s biodiversity principle of sustainability. In addition, repeated cycles of cutting and replanting can eventually deplete the nutrients in the forest\u2019s topsoil and hinder the regrowth of any type of forest on such land.\nForests Provide Important Economic and \nEcosystem Services\nBy sustaining forests, we can increase our beneficial envi-\nronmental impact, because forests provide highly valuable economic and ecosystem services (Figure 9.4 and Concept 9.1A). For example, through photosynthesis, forests re-move CO\n2 from the atmosphere and store it in organic \ncompounds, playing a role in the global carbon cycle (see Figure 3.14, p. 53). By performing this ecosystem service, forests help to stabilize average atmospheric temperatures and climate conditions.\nForests provide habitats for about two-thirds of the \nearth\u2019s terrestrial species and are home to more than 300 million people. About 1 billion people living in extreme poverty depend on forests for their survival.\nForests also provide us with important health benefits. \nFor example, traditional medicines, used by 80% of the world\u2019s people, are derived mostly from plant species that are native to forests.

The first step in harvesting trees is to build roads for access and timber removal. Even carefully designed logging roads can have a number of harmful effects (Figure 9.5)\u2014namely, topsoil erosion, sediment runoff into waterways, habitat fragmentation, and loss of biodiversity. Logging roads also expose forests to invasion by disease-causing organisms and nonnative pests, and to disturbances from human activities such as farming and ranching.\nLoggers can use a variety of methods to harvest trees. \nWith selective cutting, intermediate-aged or mature trees in \na forest are cut singly or in small groups (Figure 9.6a). However, loggers often remove all the trees from an area in what is called a clear-cut (Figure 9.6b and Figure 9.7). \nCurrently, forests and other eco -\nsystems are valued mostly for their \n economic services (Figure 9.4, right). \nEcologists and ecological economists call for us to include in such valuations the estimated monetary value of the ecosystem services provided by forests (Figure 9.A). This is a way to imple-ment the full-cost pricing princi- ple of sustainability.\nIn 1997, a team of ecologists, econ-\nomists, and geographers, led by eco-logical economist Robert Costanza, estimated the monetary worth of  \n17 ecosystem services provided by  \nthe earth\u2019s ecosystems (including, for example, pollination and regulation  \nof atmospheric temperatures) to be  \nat least $33.2 trillion per year. The \n researchers also estimated that the amount of money we would need to put into a savings account to earn that amount of interest income would be at least $500 trillion\u2014an \n average of more \nthan $70,400 for every  person on the \nearth in 2014.\nAccording to Costanza\u2019s study, the \nworld\u2019s forests alone provide us with ecosystem services worth at least  \n$4.7 trillion per year\u2014hundreds of times more than their economic value in terms of lumber, paper, and other wood products (Figure 9.A). The re-searchers pointed out that their esti-mates were very conservative.\nIn 2002, Costanza and other re-\nsearchers estimated that preserving ecosystems in a global network of na-ture reserves occupying 15% of the earth\u2019s land surface and 30% of the ocean would provide $4.4 trillion to $5.2 trillion worth of ecosystem ser -\nvices\u2014about 100 times the economic value of converting those systems to human uses.\nIf the estimates from these studies \nare close to correct, we can draw three important conclusions: (1) the earth\u2019s PUTTING A PRICE TAG ON NATURE\u2019S ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\necosystem services are essential for all humans and their economies; (2) the economic value of these services is huge; and (3) these ecosystem services will be an ongoing source of ecological income, as long as they are used sustainably.\nCritical Thinking\nSome analysts believe that we should not try to put economic values on the world\u2019s irreplaceable ecosystem services because their value is infinite.

But it can also harm an ecosystem by causing increased erosion, sediment pollu-tion of nearby waterways, and losses in biodiversity.\nA variation of clear-cutting that allows a more sustain-\nable timber yield without widespread destruction is strip cutting (Figure 9.6c). It involves clear-cutting a strip of trees along the contour of the land within a corridor nar -\nrow enough to allow natural forest regeneration within a few years. After regeneration, loggers cut another strip next to the first, and so on.Fire Can Threaten or Benefit  \nForest Ecosystems\nTwo types of fires can affect forest ecosystems. Surface fires \n(Figure 9.8, left) usually burn only undergrowth and leaf litter on the forest floor. They kill seedlings and small trees, but they spare most mature trees and allow most wild ani-mals to escape.\nOccasional surface fires have a number of ecological \nbenefits.

Crown fires usually occur in forests that have not experienced surface fires for several decades, a situation that allows dead wood, leaves, and other flammable ground litter to accumulate. These rap-idly burning fires can destroy most vegetation, kill wildlife, increase topsoil erosion, and burn or damage human structures in their paths.\nAlmost Half of the World\u2019s Forests Have \nBeen Cut Down\nDeforestation is the temporary or permanent removal of \nlarge expanses of forest for agriculture, settlements, or other uses. Surveys by the World Resources Institute (WRI) indicate that during the past 8,000 years, human activities have reduced the earth\u2019s old-growth forest cover by about 47%, with most of this loss occurring in the last 60 years.\nAccording to the WRI, if current deforestation rates \ncontinue, about 40% of the world\u2019s remaining intact for -\n90446_ch09_184-213.indd   189 8/13/14   8:40 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3487, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39bded64-439b-4724-a810-be6068dbc273": {"__data__": {"id_": "39bded64-439b-4724-a810-be6068dbc273", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "G.

Environmental writer Bill McKibben has cited this forest regrowth in the United States\u2014especially in the East\u2014as \u201cthe great envi-ronmental success story of the United States, and in some ways, the whole world.\u201d\nProtected forests make up about 40% of the country\u2019s \ntotal forest area, mostly in the National Forest System, which consists of 155 national forests managed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). On the other hand, since the mid-1960s, a large area of the nation\u2019s remaining old-growth and fairly diverse second-growth forests has been cut down and replaced with biologically simplified tree plantations.\nTropical Forests Are Disappearing Rapidly\nTropical forests (see Figure 7.14, top, p. 142) cover about 6% of the earth\u2019s land area\u2014roughly the area of the con-tinental United States. Climatic and biological data indi-cate that mature tropical forests once covered at least twice as much area as they do today. Most of this loss of half of the world\u2019s tropical forests has taken place since 1950 (see Chapter 3, Core Case Study, p. 42). Between 2000 and 2013, the world lost the equivalent of more than 50 soccer fields of tropical forest every minute. In 2014, the WRI and more than 40 other organizations, including Google and UNEP, created Global Forest Watch. This free online monitoring and mapping system provides near-real time reliable data about what is happening to the world\u2019s forests.\nSatellite scans and ground-level surveys indicate that \nlarge areas of tropical forests are being cut rapidly in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America\u2014especially in Brazil\u2019s vast Amazon Basin, which has more than 40% of the world\u2019s remaining tropical forests. Currently, these forests absorb and store about one-third of the world\u2019s terrestrial carbon emissions as part of the carbon cycle, so by reducing these forests, we reduce their carbon absorp-tion and contribute to climate change. Also, the burning and clearing of tropical forests adds carbon to the atmo-sphere, accounting for 10\u201315% of global greenhouse gas emissions.FIGURE 9.8   Surface fires (left) usually burn only undergrowth and \nleaf litter on a forest floor.

Removing large areas of trees can lead to a drier climate that dehydrates the topsoil by ex-posing it to sunlight, allowing it to be blown away. This makes it difficult for a forest to grow back in the area, and such forest areas are often replaced by tropical grassland or savanna. Scientists project that if current burning and de-forestation rates continue, 20\u201330% of the Amazon Basin will be turned into savanna within the next 50 years, and most of it could become savanna by 2080.\nStudies indicate that at least half of the world\u2019s known \nspecies of terrestrial plants, animals, and insects live in tropical forests. Because of their specialized niches, many of these species are highly vulnerable to extinction when their forest habitats are destroyed or degraded. The FAO warns that at the current global rate of tropical deforesta-tion, as much as 50% of the world\u2019s remaining old-growth tropical forests will be gone or severely degraded by the end of this century (Concept 9.1B)\nTropical deforestation results from a number of under -\nlying and direct causes. Underlying causes, such as pres-sures from population growth and poverty, push subsistence farmers and the landless poor into tropical forests, where they cut or burn trees for firewood or try to grow enough food to survive. Government subsidies can accelerate other direct causes such as large-scale logging and ranching by reducing the costs of these enterprises.\nThe major direct causes of deforestation vary in differ -\nent tropical areas. Tropical forests in the Amazon and other South American countries are cleared or burned primarily for cattle grazing and large soybean plantations (see Figure 1.4, p. 8). In Indonesia, Malaysia, and other areas of Southeast Asia, tropical forests are being replaced by large plantations of oil palm, which produce palm oil used to make several products, including biodiesel fuel and cosmetics. In Africa, the primary direct cause of deforesta-tion is people clearing plots for small-scale farming and harvesting wood for fuel.\nThe degradation of a tropical forest usually begins \nwhen a road is cut deep into the forest interior for logging and settlement (Figure 9.5). Loggers then use selective cutting (Figure 9.6a) to remove the largest and best trees. When these big trees fall, many other trees often fall with them because of their shallow roots and the network of vines connecting the trees in the forest\u2019s canopy.\nInternational corporations do much of this logging and \nthen they often sell the land to ranchers who burn the remaining timber to clear the land for cattle grazing. Within a few years, their cattle typically overgraze the land and the ranchers move on, selling the degraded land to large-scale farm operators who plow it up to plant large crops such as soybeans (see Figure 1.4, p. 8), or to settlers for small-scale farming. After a few years of crop growing and erosion from rain, the nutrient-poor topsoil is de-pleted of nutrients. Then the farmers and settlers move on to newly cleared land to repeat this environmentally de-structive process.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Tropical Forests\nWhy should you care if most of the world\u2019s remaining tropical forests are \nburned or cleared or converted to savanna within your lifetime?

Certification of sustainably grown timber and of sustainably produced forest products can help consumers to play their part in reaching this goal. The nonprofit Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) oversees the certification of forestry operations that meet certain standards. To gain such certification, operators must make sure that: any cutting of trees does not exceed long-term forest regeneration in a given area; roads and harvesting systems do not cause unreasonable ecological damage; for -\nest topsoil does not become unreasonably damaged; and downed wood and standing dead trees be left to provide wildlife habitat.\nThe FSC reported that, by 2012, about 5% of the \nworld\u2019s forest area in 80 countries had been certified ac-cording to FSC standards. The FSC also certifies 5,400 manufacturers and distributors of wood products. The paper used in this book was produced with the use of sus-tainably grown timber, as certified by the FSC, and con-tains recycled paper fibers.\nLoggers could use more sustainable selective cutting \n(Figure 9.6a) and strip cutting (Figure 9.6c) to harvest tropical trees for lumber instead of clear-cutting the forests (Figure 9.6b). They could also be more careful when cut-ting and removing individual trees by taking care to cut canopy vines (lianas) before felling a tree to reduce dam-age to neighboring trees.\nMany economists are urging governments to begin \nmaking a shift to more sustainable forest management by phasing out government subsidies and tax breaks that en-courage forest degradation and deforestation and replacing them with forest-sustaining economic rewards. This would likely lead to higher prices on unsustainably produced timber and wood products, in keeping with the full-cost pricing principle of sustainability. Costa Rica (Core \nCase Study) is taking a lead in using this approach. Governments can also encourage tree-planting programs to help restore degraded forests. \nGREEN CAREER:  Sustain-\nable forestry\nWe Can Improve the Management of \nForest Fires\nIn the United States, the Smokey Bear educational cam-\npaign undertaken by the Forest Service and the National Advertising Council has prevented many forest fires, saved many lives, and prevented billions of dollars in losses of trees, wildlife, and human structures. At the same time, it has convinced much of the public that all forest fires are bad and should be prevented or put out. Ecologists warn that trying to prevent all forest fires can make matters worse by increasing the likelihood of destructive crown fires (Figure 9.8, right) due to the accumulation of highly flammable underbrush in some forests.\nEcologists and forest fire experts have proposed several \nstrategies for reducing fire-related harm to forests and to people who use or live in the forests, including:\n\u2022\t Using\n\tcarefully \tplanned\tand\tcontrolled \tprescribed burns  \nto remove flammable small trees and underbrush in \nthe highest-risk forest areas.\n\u2022\t Allowing \tsome\tfires\ton\tpublic\tlands\tto\tburn\t\nunderbrush and smaller trees, as long as the fires do not threaten human structures or human lives.\n\u2022\t Protecting\n\thouses\tand\tother\tbuildings \tin\tfire-prone \t\nareas by thinning trees and other vegetation in a zone around them and eliminating", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3755, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75f572ee-f905-40ec-a947-f6c2991f55e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "75f572ee-f905-40ec-a947-f6c2991f55e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "G.

This results from inefficient use of construction materials, excessive packaging, overuse of junk mail, inadequate paper recycling, and the failure to reuse or find substitutes for wooden shipping containers.\nOne reason for cutting trees is to provide pulp for mak-\ning paper, but we can make paper by using fiber from sources other than trees. China uses rice straw and other agricultural residues to make much of its paper. Most of the small amount of tree-free paper produced in the United States is made from the fibers of a rapidly growing woody annual plant called kenaf (pronounced \u201ckuh-\nNAHF,\u201d Figure 9.12). Kenaf and other nontree fibers such as hemp yield more paper pulp per area of land than tree farms do and require less use of pesticides and herbicides.\nAnother way to reduce the demand for tree cutting is \nto sharply reduce the use of throwaway paper products made from trees. We can instead choose reusable plates, cups, cloth napkins and handkerchiefs, and cloth bags.More than 2 billion people in less-developed countries \nuse fuelwood (see Figure 6.11, p. 111) and charcoal made from wood for heating and cooking. Most of these coun-tries are suffering from fuelwood shortages because people are cutting trees for fuelwood and forest products 10\u201320 times faster than new trees are being planted (Figure 9.13). In Guatemala, which is threatened by severe defor -\nestation, scientists estimate that fuelwood harvesting ac-counts for more than 55% of the annual deforestation.\nOne way to reduce the severity of the fuelwood crisis \nin less-developed countries is to establish small plantations of fast-growing trees and shrubs around farms and in com-munity woodlots. Another way, as is being done in Guate-mala, is to produce biomass briquettes as a substitute for fuelwood. The National Geographic Society is funding a project led by the Legacy Foundation in cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Progresar that aims to establish local enter -\nprises that will create biomass briquette production busi-nesses, training businesses, and a network of producers to spread the word about the viability of biomass as a fuel-wood alternative. This could bolster the Guatemalan econ-omy and support women\u2019s empowerment, while reducing deforestation.\nThere Are Several Ways to Reduce  \nTropical Deforestation\nAnalysts have suggested various ways to protect tropical \nforests and use them more sustainably (Figure 9.14).\nAt the international level, debt-for-nature swaps can \nmake it financially attractive for countries to protect their tropical forests. In such swaps, participating countries act as custodians of protected forest reserves in return for foreign aid or debt relief. In a similar strategy, called con-servation concessions, governments or private conservation organizations pay nations for agreeing to preserve their natural resources.\nNational governments can also take important steps to \nreduce deforestation (Core Case Study). Between 2005 and 2013, Brazil cut its deforestation rate by 80% by cracking down on illegal logging and setting aside a large conservation reserve in the Amazon Basin. Govern-ments can also subsidize sustainable forestry and the planting of trees.\nConsumers can reduce the demand for unsustainable \nand illegal logging in tropical forests by buying only wood and wood products that have been certified as \n sustainably \nproduced by the FSC and other organizations, including  \nthe Rainforest Alliance and the Sustainability Action  Net- \nwork.

Rangelands are unfenced grasslands in temperate and tropical climates that supply forage, or vegetation for grazing (grass-eating) and browsing (shrub-eating) animals. Cattle, sheep, and goats graze on about 42% of the world\u2019s grassland. The 2005 UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment\u2014a 4-year study by 1,360 experts from 95 countries\u2014estimated that this could increase to 70% by 2050. Livestock also graze in pastures, which are managed grasslands or fenced mead-ows often planted with domesticated grasses or other for -\nage crops such as alfalfa and clover.\nBlades of rangeland grass grow from the base, not at the \ntip as broadleaf plants do. Thus, as long as only the upper portion of the blade is eaten and its lower portion remains, rangeland grass is a renewable resource that can be grazed again and again. Moderate levels of grazing are healthy for grasslands, because removal of mature vegetation stimulates rapid regrowth and encourages greater plant diversity.\nOvergrazing occurs when too many animals graze for \ntoo long, damaging the grasses and their roots, and exceeding the carrying capacity of a rangeland area (Figure 9.15, left). Overgrazing reduces grass cover, exposes the topsoil to ero-sion by water and wind, and compacts the soil, which lessens its capacity to hold water. Overgrazing also encourages the invasion of rangeland by species such as sagebrush, mes-quite, cactus, and cheatgrass, which cattle will not eat. The FAO has estimated that overgrazing by livestock has reduced productivity on as much as 20% of the world\u2019s rangeland.\nWe Can Manage Rangelands  \nMore Sustainably\nThe most widely used way to manage rangelands more \nsustainably is to control the number of grazing animals and the duration of their grazing in a given area so the carrying capacity of the area is not exceeded (Concept 9.3). One method for doing this is called rotational grazing, in which cattle are confined by portable fencing to one area for a few days and then moved to a new location.\nCattle like to graze around natural water sources, espe-\ncially along streams or rivers lined by strips of vegetation known as riparian zones, and around ponds. Overgrazing can destroy the vegetation in such areas (Figure 9.16, left). Ranchers can protect overgrazed land through rotational grazing and by fencing off damaged areas, which eventu-ally leads to their natural restoration by ecological succes-sion (Figure 9.16, right).\nA more expensive and less widely used method of \nrangeland management is to suppress the growth of un-wanted invader plants by the use of herbicides, mechani-cal removal, or controlled burning. A cheaper way to discourage unwanted vegetation in some areas is through controlled, short-term trampling by large numbers of live-stock such as sheep, goats, and cattle that destroy the in-vasive plants\u2019 root systems.FIGURE 9.15   Natural capital deg-\nradation: To the left of the fence", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3540, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "138be040-18cd-4655-8966-cd84f18e415d": {"__data__": {"id_": "138be040-18cd-4655-8966-cd84f18e415d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "G.

However, most of these parks are too small to sustain many large animal species. And many parks suffer from invasions by harmful nonnative species that compete with and reduce the populations of native species. Some national parks are so popular that large numbers of visitors are degrading the natural features that make them attractive (see the Case Study that follows).\nParks in less-developed countries have the greatest \nbiodiversity of all the world\u2019s parks, but only about 1% of these parklands are protected. Local people in many of these countries enter the parks illegally in search of wood, game animals, and other natural products that they need for their daily survival. Loggers and miners operate ille-gally in many of these parks, as do wildlife poachers who kill animals to obtain and sell items such as rhino horns (see Figure 8.11, p. 174), elephant tusks, and furs. Park services in most of the less-developed countries have too little money and too few personnel to fight these inva-sions, either by force or through education.CASE STUDY\nStresses on U.S. Public Parks\nThe U.S. National Park System, established in 1912, in-cludes 59 major national parks, sometimes called the country\u2019s crown jewels (see chapter-opening photo), along with 339 monuments and historic sites. States, counties, and cities also operate public parks.\nPopularity is one of the biggest problems for many \nparks. Between 1960 and 2012, the number of recre-ational visitors to U.S. national parks more than tripled, reaching about 282 million. In some U.S. parks and other public lands, noisy and polluting dirt bikes, dune buggies, jet skis, snowmobiles, and other off-road vehicles destroy or damage fragile vegetation, disturb wildlife, and degrade the aesthetic experience for many visitors.\nA number of parks also suffer damage from the migra-\ntion or deliberate introduction of nonnative species. For example, European wild boars, imported into the state of North Carolina in 1912 for hunting, now threaten vegeta-tion in parts of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Nonnative mountain goats in Washington State\u2019s Olympic National Park trample and destroy the root systems of na-tive vegetation and accelerate soil erosion.\nAt the same time, native species\u2014some of them threat-\nened or endangered\u2014are killed in, or illegally removed from, almost half of all U.S. national parks. This is what happened to the gray wolf in Yellowstone National Park until it was successfully reintroduced there after a 50-year absence (Science Focus 9.2).\nMany U.S. national parks have become threatened is-\nlands of biodiversity surrounded by commercial develop-\nFIGURE 9.16   Natural capital restoration: In the mid-1980s, cattle \nhad degraded the vegetation and soil on this stream bank along the \nSan Pedro River in the U.S. state of Arizona (left).

They survived mostly by preying on abun-dant bison, elk, caribou, and deer. \nhowever, between 1850 and 1900, \nmost of them were shot, trapped, or poisoned by ranchers, hunters, and government employees, and they were driven to near extinction in the lower 48 states.\nEcologists recognize the important \nrole that this keystone predator species once played. In the Yellowstone Na-tional Park region, the wolves culled herds of bison, elk, moose, and mule deer, and kept down coyote popula-tions. By leaving some of their kills par -\ntially uneaten, they provided meat for scavengers such as ravens, bald eagles, ermines, grizzly bears, and foxes.\nWhen the number of gray wolves \ndeclined, herds of plant-browsing elk, moose, and mule deer expanded and devastated the willow and aspen trees REINTRODUCING THE GRAY WOLF TO YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK\nFIGURE 9.B   After becoming almost extinct \nin much of the western United States, the \ngray wolf was listed and protected as an endangered species in 1974.\ngrowing near streams and rivers. This \nled to increased soil erosion and to de-clining populations of other wildlife species such as beaver, which eat wil-low and aspen. This in turn affected species that depended on wetlands created by dam-building beavers.\nWhen Congress passed the U.S. En-\ndangered Species Act in 1973, only a few hundred gray wolves remained outside of Alaska, primarily in Minne-sota and Michigan. In 1974, the gray wolf was listed as an endangered spe-cies in the lower 48 states.\nIn 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService (USFWS) proposed reintroduc-ing gray wolves into the Yellowstone National Park to try to help stabilize the ecosystem. The proposal brought angry protests from area ranchers who feared the wolves would leave the park and attack their cattle and sheep, and from hunters who feared the wolves would kill too many big-game animals.

Fig-ure 9.17 is a map of the earth\u2019s remaining wildlands.\nConservation biologists call for fully protecting at least \n20% of the earth\u2019s land area in a global system of biodiver -\nsity reserves that would include multiple examples of all the earth\u2019s biomes (Concept 9.4). In 2012, the IUCN esti-mated that making this investment to protect a vital part of our life-support system would cost roughly $23 billion a year\u2014more than 4 times what is spent on such protec-tion today.\nMost developers and resource extractors oppose pro-\ntecting even 13% of the earth\u2019s land, arguing that these areas might contain valuable resources that would provide ment. Nearby human activities that threaten wildlife and recreational values in many national parks include mining, logging, livestock grazing, use of coal-fired power plants, water diversion, and urban development.

In contrast, ecologists and \nconservation biologists view protected areas as islands of biodiversity and ecosystem services that help to sustain all life and economies indefinitely and that serve as centers of future evolution. In other words, they serve as an \u201ceco-logical insurance policy\u201d for us and other species. (See the online Guest Essay on this topic by Norman Myers.)\nConservation biologists call for using the buffer zone \nconcept whenever possible to design and manage nature reserves. This means strictly protecting an inner core of a reserve, usually by establishing two buffer zones in which local people can extract resources sustainably without harming the inner core (see the Case Study that follows). By 2012, the United Nations had used this concept to cre-ate a global network of 621 biosphere reserves in 117 countries.CASE STUDY\nIdentifying and Protecting Biodiversity in \nCosta Rica\nFor several decades, Costa Rica (Core Case Study) has been \nusing government and private research agencies to iden-tify the plants and animals that make it one of the world\u2019s most biologically diverse countries. The government has consolidated the country\u2019s parks and reserves into several large conservation areas, or megareserves, designed with the goal of sustaining about 80% of the country\u2019s biodiversity (Figure 9.18).\nEach reserve contains a protected inner core sur -\nrounded by two buffer zones that local and indigenous people can use for sustainable logging, crop farming, cattle grazing, hunting, fishing, and ecotourism. Instead of shut-would halt their operations on wolf-\npopulated federal lands.\nIn 1995 and 1996, federal wildlife \nofficials caught gray wolves in Canada and northwest Montana and relocated 41 of them in Yellowstone National Park. Scientists estimate that the long-term carrying capacity of the park is 110 to 150 gray wolves. By 2007, the park had 171 wolves, but that number had dropped to 82 by the end of 2012, for various reasons having to do mostly with the supply of prey for the wolves. Such population fluctuations are natural, according to the National Park Service.\nWildlife ecologist Robert Crabtree \nand other scientists have been studying the effects of this reintroduction. They have put radio collars on most of the park\u2019s wolves to gather data and track their movements. They have also stud-ied changes in vegetation and in the populations of various plant and ani-mal species.\nStudies indicate that the return of \nthis keystone predator has contributed to a decline in populations of elk, the wolves\u2019 primary food source. The leftovers of elk killed by wolves have also been an important food source for scavengers such as bald eagles and ra-vens. The wolves\u2019 presence, with a pro-jected decline in elk numbers, was supposed to promote the regrowth of young aspen trees that elk feed on and had depleted. \nhowever, a 2010 study \nled by U.S. Geological Survey scientist Matthew Kauffman indicated that the aspen were not recovering despite a 60% decline in elk numbers. Declining populations of elk were also supposed to allow for the return of willow trees along streams. Research indicates that willows have only partly recovered.\nThe wolves have cut in half the \n Yellowstone population of coyotes\u2014the top predators in the absence of wolves. This has reduced coyote attacks on cattle from area ranches and has led to larger populations of small animals such as ground squirrels, mice, and go-phers, which are hunted by coyotes, eagles, and hawks. Overall, this experi-ment has had some important eco\n-\nlogical benefits for the Yellowstone ecosystem. \nhowever, some scientists \nhypothesize that the long-term absence of wolves led to a number of changes in plant and animal numbers and diver -\nsity that are difficult to reverse.\nThe wolf reintroduction has pro-\nduced economic benefits for the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3903, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbf29a4f-53eb-4920-9c59-70aba2bb7d99": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbf29a4f-53eb-4920-9c59-70aba2bb7d99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "G.

In 2013, the USFWS pro-posed removing the gray wolf from the U.S. endangered species list in the lower 48 states and turning over wolf protection responsibilities to state wild-life agencies. More than 750,000 Americans sent comments to the US-FWS stating their opposition to this plan.

Theodore Roos-evelt (see Figure 1.15, p. 19), the first U.S. president to set aside protected areas, summarized his thoughts on what to do with wilderness: \u201cLeave it as it is. You cannot improve it.\u201d\nSome critics oppose protecting large areas for their sce-\nnic and recreational value, arguing that such areas could contribute greatly to economic development. Conserva-tion biologists contend that the most important reasons for protecting wilderness areas is not for their scenic, recre-ational, or economic value, but for the long-term needs of all species\u2014to preserve biodiversity as a vital part of the earth\u2019s natural capital and to protect wilderness areas as cen-ters for evolution in response to mostly unpredictable changes in environmental conditions.\nIn 1964, the U.S. Congress passed the Wilderness Act, \nwhich allowed the government to protect undeveloped tracts of U.S. public land from development as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System (Figure 9.19). The area of protected wilderness grew by nearly twelve-fold between 1964 and 2012. Even so, only about 5% of all U.S. land is protected as wilderness\u2014more than 54% of it in Alaska. Only about 2.7% of the land area of the lower 48 states is protected as wilderness, most of it in the West, and most of these areas are threatened habitat islands in a sea of development.\n90446_ch09_184-213.indd   200 8/13/14   8:40 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

These areas have suffered serious ecological disruption, mostly because of rapid human population growth and the resulting pressure on natural resources and ecosystem ser -\nvices. Environmental scientist Norman Myers first proposed this idea in 1988 (see his online Guest Essay on this topic).\nFigure 9.20 shows 34 terrestrial biodiversity hotspots \nidentified by biologists. (For a map of hotspots in the United States, see Figure 7, p. S22, in Supplement 4.) These areas cover little more than 2% of the earth\u2019s land surface, but they contain an estimated 50% of the world\u2019s flowering plant species and 42% of all terrestrial vertebrates (mam-mals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians), according to the IUCN. Yet, only about 5% of the total area of these hotspots is truly protected with government funding and law enforcement.\nBiodiversity hotspots are also home to a large majority \nof the world\u2019s endangered or critically endangered species, as well as to 1.2 billion people\u2014one-sixth of the world\u2019s population. In 2012, the IUCN began publishing its Red List of Ecosystems that are vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered as a companion to its Red List of Threatened Species.\nProtecting Ecosystem Services Is Another \nUrgent Priority\nAnother way to help sustain the earth\u2019s biodiversity is to \nidentify and protect areas where vital ecosystem services (see the orange boxed labels in Figure 1.3, p. 7) are being impaired enough to reduce biodiversity and harm local residents.\nThis approach has received more attention since the \nrelease of the 2005 UN Millennium Ecosystem Assess-ment. It identified key ecosystem services that provide numerous ecological and economic benefits, including those provided by forests (Figure 9.4). The study pointed out that humans are degrading or overusing about 60% of the ecosystem services provided by various ecosystems around the world, and it outlined ways to help sustain these vital services. One such way is to set aside and pro-ANIMATED FIGURE 9.20  Endangered natural capital: Biologists have identified these 34 biodiver -\nsity hotspots.

These would be areas where \npoverty levels are high and where a large part of the economy depends on various ecosystem services that are being degraded severely enough to threaten humans and other species. In such areas, residents, public officials, and conservation scientists would work together to develop strategies to help protect human communities along with the natural biodiversity and ecosystem services that sup-port all life and economies. Thus, instead of pitting people against nature, this approach applies the win-win principle of sustainability.\nWe Can Rehabilitate and Partially Restore \nEcosystems That We Have Damaged\nAlmost every natural place on the earth has been affected \nor degraded to some degree by human activities. We can partially reverse much of this harm through ecological restoration: the process of repairing damage caused by humans to various ecosystems. Examples include replant-ing forests (see the Case Study that follows), reintroducing native species (Science Focus 9.2), removing harmful in-vasive species, freeing river flows by removing dams, and restoring grasslands, coral reefs, wetlands, and stream banks (Figure 9.16, right). This is an important way to expand our beneficial environmental impact.\nBy studying how natural ecosystems recover, scientists \nare learning how to employ and enhance ecological suc-cession processes by using a variety of approaches, includ-ing the following four:\n\u2022\tRestoration: returning a degraded habitat or ecosystem \nto a condition as similar as possible to its natural state in cases where this is feasible.\n\u2022\tRehabilitation: turning a degraded ecosystem into a functional or useful ecosystem without trying to restore it to its original condition. Examples include removing pollutants from abandoned mining or industrial sites and replanting trees to reduce soil erosion in clear-cut forests.\n\u2022\tReplacement: replacing a degraded ecosystem with another type of ecosystem.

This is an application of the biodiversity and win-win principles of sustainability.\nWe Can Share Areas We Dominate with \nOther Species\nEcologist Michael L. Rosenzweig suggests that we develop \na form of conservation biology called reconciliation ecology. This scientific approach focuses on establishing and maintaining new habitats to conserve species diversity in places where people live, work, or play. In other words, the focus is on increasing our beneficial environmental impact by learning how to share some of the spaces we dominate with other species.\nFor example, people can learn how protection of local \nwildlife and ecosystems can provide economic resources for their communities by encouraging sustainable forms of ecotourism. In the Central American coun-try of Belize, for instance, conservation biologist Robert Horwich helped establish a local sanctuary for the black howler monkey. He convinced local farmers to set aside strips of forest to serve as habitats and corridors through which these monkeys can travel. The reserve, run by a lo-cal women\u2019s cooperative, has attracted ecotourists and bi-ologists. Local residents receive income for housing and guiding these visitors.\nWithout proper controls, ecotourism can lead to degra-\ndation of popular sites if they are overrun by visitors or are degraded by the construction of nearby hotels and other tourist facilities. However, when managed properly, eco-tourism can be a useful form of reconciliation ecology.\nReconciliation ecology is also a way to protect vital \necosystem services. For example, some people are learning how to protect insect pollinators, such as butterflies and \nGOOD\nNEWShoneybees (see Chapter 8, Core Case Study, p. 162), which \nare vulnerable to pesticides and habitat loss. Neighbor -\nhoods and municipal governments are doing this by reduc-ing or eliminating the use of pesticides on their lawns, fields, golf courses, and parks. Neighbors also work to-gether to plant gardens of flowering plants as a source of food for bees and other pollinators. According to some honeybee experts, people trying to help bees in this way must avoid using glyphosate herbicides (such as Roundup\u00ae) and plants that contain neonicotinoid insecticides.\nPeople have also worked together to protect bluebirds \nwithin human-dominated habitats where most of the bluebirds\u2019 nesting trees have been cut down and bluebird populations have declined. Special boxes were designed for nesting bluebirds, and with their widespread use, blue-bird numbers are rising again.\nThese and many other examples of people working \ntogether on projects to restore degraded ecosystems all involve applications of the biodiversity and win-win principles of sustainability. Figure 9.21 lists some ways in which you can help to sustain the earth\u2019s terres-trial biodiversity.\n9.6 HOW CAN WE HELP TO \nSUSTAIN AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY?\nCONCEPT 9.6   We can help to sustain aquatic biodiversity \nand increase our beneficial environmental impact by estab-\nlishing protected sanctuaries, managing coastal develop-ment, reducing water pollution, and preventing overfishing.\nHuman Activities Are Destroying and \nDegrading Aquatic Biodiversity\nHuman activities have destroyed or degraded a large por -\ntion of the world\u2019s coastal wetlands, coral reefs, man-\ngroves, and ocean bottom, and disrupted many of the world\u2019s freshwater ecosystems.

Today, coral reefs, on average, are exposed to the warmest and most acidic ocean waters of the past 400,000 years. According to the WRI, by 2050, some 90% of the world\u2019s shallow tropical coral reefs will be threat-ened by coral bleaching caused by warmer ocean water and by ocean acidification.\nHabitat disruption is also a problem in fresh-\nwater aquatic zones. The main causes of disrup-tion are dam building and excessive water withdrawal from rivers for irrigation and urban water supplies. These activities destroy aquatic habitats, degrade water flows, and disrupt fresh-water biodiversity.\nAnother problem that threatens aquatic bio-\ndiversity is the deliberate or accidental introduc-tion of hundreds of harmful invasive species (Figure 9.23) into coastal waters, wetlands, and lakes throughout the world.

Globally, CO\n2 emissions \nhave risen by about 45% between 1992 and 2013. Extensive research in-dicates that if we continue to increase CO\n2 levels in the atmosphere, we will \nplay a role in disrupting the earth\u2019s cli-mate during this century.\nAnother problem related to CO\n2 \nemissions is ocean acidification, a change in ocean chemistry. The oceans have absorbed about one-fourth of the excess CO\n2 that human activities have \nadded to the atmosphere. When this absorbed CO\n2 combines with ocean \nwater, it forms carbonic acid ( h2CO 3), a \nweak acid also found in carbonated drinks. As a result, the level of hydro-gen ions (\nh+) in the water rises, mak-\ning the water less basic, while the level of carbonate ions (CO\n32\u2212) in the water \ndrops because these ions react with hydrogen ions (\nh+) to form bicarbon-\nate ions ( hCO 3\u2212).\nThe problem is that many aquatic \nspecies, including phytoplankton, corals, sea snails, crabs, and oysters, use carbonate ions to produce calcium carbonate (CaCO\n3), the main compo-\nnent of their shells and bones. As a re-sult, in less basic waters, shell-building species and coral reefs grow more slowly (Figure 9.C), and when the hy-drogen ion concentration of the sur -\nrounding seawater gets high enough, their calcium carbonate begins to dis-solve. These effects will occur first in colder ocean waters, because they have a greater capacity for absorption of CO\n2 from the atmosphere than \nwarmer waters have.\nSince we began burning fossil fuels \nin large quantities during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centu-ries, there has been a 30% rise in the average acidity (actually a 30% de-crease in average basicity) of surface ocean water, according to a 2010 UNEP summary of research on this problem. A 2013 report prepared by 540 scientists from 37 countries pro-jected that, by 2100, we could see a 170% drop in the average basicity of surface ocean water because of in-creasing acidity levels. The report also warned that this would reduce the ability of the oceans to help in regulat-ing the rate of climate change by ab-sorbing CO\n2, and that it could \njeopardize the stability of marine eco-systems and lead to a loss of some $130 billion a year for the fishing industry.\nAccording to most marine scientists, \nthe only way to slow these changes is through a quick and sharp reduction in the use of fossil fuels around the world, which would lessen the massive inputs of CO\n2 into the air and from \nthere into the ocean. We can also slow the rise of acidity levels in ocean wa-ters by protecting and restoring man-grove forests, sea grasses, and coastal wetlands, because these aquatic sys-tems take up and store some of the at-mospheric CO\n2 that is at the heart of \nthis problem.\nCritical Thinking\nhow might widespread losses of some \nforms of marine aquatic life due to ocean acidification affect life on land? \nhow might it affect your life?

Today, fish are hunted throughout the world\u2019s oceans by a global fleet of about 4.4 million fishing boats.\nIndustrial fishing fleets use global satellite positioning \nequipment, sonar fish-finding devices, huge nets and long fishing lines, spotter planes, and refrigerated factory ships that can process and freeze their enormous catches. These highly efficient fleets help to supply the growing demand for seafood, but critics say that they are vacuuming the seas, reducing marine biodiversity, and degrading impor -\ntant marine ecosystem services.

It is based on the concept of an ecological footprint (see Figure 1.10, p. 12). According to the Fishprint of Nations 2006, all fishing nations together are harvesting well over half again as many wild fish as the fish popula-tions can sustain in the long run. According to the Woods Hole National Fisheries Service, 57% of the world\u2019s fisheries are fully exploited and 30% are overexploited or depleted. Such overharvesting has led to the collapse of some of the world\u2019s major fisheries (Figure 9.25).\nOne result of the increasingly efficient global hunt for \nfish is that larger individuals of commercially valuable wild species\u2014including cod, marlin, swordfish, and tuna\u2014are becoming scarce. Between 1950 and 2006, according to a study led by marine ecologist Boris Worm, 90% or more of these and other large, predatory, open-ocean fishes dis-appeared. Another effect of overfishing is that when larger predatory species dwindle, rapidly reproducing invasive species such as jellyfish can more easily take over and dis-rupt ocean food webs.\nAlso, as commercially valuable large species are over -\nfished, the fishing industry has begun working its way down marine food webs by shifting to smaller marine spe-cies such as anchovies, herring, sardines, and shrimp-like krill\u2014known as forage fish. About 90% of this catch is converted to fishmeal and fish oil, most of which is fed to farmed fish. Scientists warn that this will reduce the food supply for larger species, which will likely then have a harder time rebounding from overfishing. The end result will likely be further disruption of marine ecosystems and their ecosystem services.\nWe Can Protect and Help Sustain  \nMarine Biodiversity\nProtecting marine biodiversity is difficult for several reasons. \nFirst, the human ecological footprint and fishprint are ex-panding so rapidly that it is difficult to monitor their impacts. Second, much of the damage to the oceans and other bodies of water is not visible to most people. Third, many people incorrectly view the seas as an inexhaustible resource that can absorb an almost infinite amount of waste and pollution and still produce all the seafood we want. Fourth, most of the world\u2019s ocean area lies outside the legal jurisdiction of any country. Thus, much of it is an open-access resource, subject to overexploitation\u2014a classic example of the tragedy of the commons (see Chapter 1, pp. 11\u201312).\nNevertheless, there are several ways to protect and \nsustain marine biodiversity, thereby increasing our benefi-cial environmental impact (Concept 9.6). For example, we can protect endangered and threatened aquatic species, as discussed in Chapter 8, and we can restore and sustain streams, wetlands, and other aquatic systems.\nWe can also establish protected marine sanctuaries. Since \n1986, the IUCN has helped to establish a global system of marine protected areas (MPAs)\u2014areas of ocean partially pro-\ntected from human activities. According to the U.S. Na-tional Ocean Service, there are more than 5,800 MPAs worldwide (more than 1,600 in U.S. waters), covering about 2.8% of the world\u2019s ocean surface, and their num-bers are growing. However, most MPAs allow dredging, trawler fishing, and other ecologically harmful resource extraction activities. And many of them are too small to be effective in protecting larger species.\nMany scientists and policymakers call for protecting \nand sustaining entire marine ecosystems within a global network of fully protected marine reserves, some", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3801, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4dcb853-c0e3-4647-b007-91feb2c83988": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4dcb853-c0e3-4647-b007-91feb2c83988", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "G.

Doing this will require imple-\nmenting an ecosystem approach to sustaining both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. According to Edward O. Wilson, such a conservation strategy would cost about $30 billion per year\u2014an amount that could be provided by a tax of one penny per cup of coffee consumed in the world each year.\nThis strategy for protecting the earth\u2019s vital biodiver -\nsity and increasing our beneficial environmental impact will not be implemented without bottom-up political pressure on elected officials from individual citizens and groups. It will also require cooperation among scientists, engineers, and key people in government and the private sector. And it will be important for individuals to \u201cvote with their wallets\u201d by trying to buy only products and services that do not have harmful impacts on terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity.\u2022 The economic values of the ecosystem services \nprovided by the world\u2019s ecosystems are far \ngreater than the value of raw materials obtained from those systems.\n\u2022\n We can sustain terrestrial biodiversity and \necosystem services and increase our beneficial \nenvironmental impact by protecting severely threatened areas, protecting remaining undisturbed areas, restoring damaged ecosystems, and sharing with other species much of the land we dominate.\n\u2022\n We can sustain aquatic biodiversity and increase \nour beneficial environmental impact by \nestablishing protected marine sanctuaries, managing coastal development, reducing water pollution, and preventing overfishing.BIG IDEAS\nIn this chapter,  we looked at how human ac-\ntivities are destroying or degrading much of the earth\u2019s terres-\ntrial and aquatic biodiversity. We discussed the importance of preserving what remains of richly diverse and highly endan-gered biodiversity hotspots and of sustaining the earth\u2019s eco-system services. We also saw how we can reduce this destruction and degradation by using the earth\u2019s resources more sustainably and by employing restoration ecology and reconciliation ecology. The Core Case Study introduced much of this by reporting on what Costa Rica is doing to protect and restore its precious biodiversity.\nPreserving terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity involves  \napplying the three scientific principles of sustainability.  First, it means respecting biodiversity and understanding the value of sustaining it. Also, if we rely less on fossil fuels and more on direct solar energy and its indirect forms, such as wind and flowing water, we will generate less pollution and interfere less with chemical cycling and other forms of natural capital that sustain biodiversity and our own lives and economies.\nWe can also apply the three social science principles of \nsustainability to help preserve biodiversity. By placing economic value on ecosystem services, we would more clearly acknowledge their importance. By working together to find win-win solutions to problems of environmental degradation, we would benefit both the earth and its people. The search for such solutions could be guided by an ethical responsibility to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services for current and future generations.TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nSustaining Costa Rica\u2019s Biodiversity\nEduardo Rivero/Shutterstock.comGOOD\nNEWS\n90446_ch09_184-213.indd   210 8/13/14   8:41 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Why do you think Costa Rica (Core Case Study) has set aside a much larger percentage of its land for bio-diversity conservation than the United States has? Should the United States reserve more of its land for this purpose? Explain.\n 2. If we fail to protect a much larger percentage of the world\u2019s remaining old-growth forests and tropical rain forests, what are three harmful effects that this failure is likely to have on any children and grand-children you eventually might have?\n 3. In the early 1990s, Miguel Sanchez, a subsistence farmer in Costa Rica, was offered $600,000 by a \n hotel developer for a piece of land that he and his family had been using sustainably for many years. An area under rapid development surrounded the land, which contained an old-growth rain forest and a black sand beach. Sanchez refused the offer. Ex-plain how Sanchez\u2019s decision was an application of one of the social science principles of sustain- ability.  What would you have done if you were  \nSanchez? Explain.\n 4. Should more-developed countries provide at least half of the money needed to help preserve the re-maining tropical forests in less-developed countries? Explain. Do you think that the long-term economic and ecological benefits of doing this would outweigh the short-term economic costs? Explain.\n 5. Are you in favor of establishing more wilderness ar -\neas in the United States (or in the country where you live)? Explain. What might be some drawbacks of doing this?\n 6. You are a defense attorney arguing in court for pre-serving an old-growth forest that developers want to clear for a suburban development. Give your three strongest arguments for preserving this ecosystem. How would you counter the argument that preserv-ing the forest would harm the economy by causing a loss of jobs in the timber industry?\n 7. What do you think are the three greatest threats to aquatic biodiversity and aquatic ecosystem services? For each of them, explain your thinking. Imagine that you are a national official in charge of setting policy for preserving aquatic biodiversity and outline a plan for dealing specifically with these threats.\n 8. Some scientists consider ocean acidification to be one of the most serious environmental and economic threats that the world faces. How do you think you might be contributing to ocean acidification in your daily life? What are three things you could do to help reduce the threat of ocean acidification?\nDoing Environmental Science\nPick an area near where you live or go to school that hosts a variety of plants and animals. It could be a yard, an abandoned lot, a park, a forest, or some part of your campus. Visit this area at least three times and make a survey of the plants and animals that you find there, in-cluding any trees, shrubs, groundcover plants, insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Also, take a small sample of the topsoil and find out what organisms are living there. (Be careful to get permission from who-ever owns or manages the land before doing any digging.) Using guidebooks and other resources to help identify dif-ferent species, record your findings and categorize them into the general types of organisms listed above. Then do some research to find out about the ecosystem services that some or all of these organisms provide. Try to find and record five of these services.

The unit of area used in fishprint analy-sis is the global hectare (gha), a unit weighted to reflect the relative ecological productivity of the area fished. When compared with the fishing area\u2019s sustainable bioca-pacity (its ability to provide a stable supply of fish year af-ter year, expressed in terms of yield per area), its fishprint indicates whether the country\u2019s annual fishing harvest is sustainable. The fishprint and biocapacity are calculated using the following formulas:\nFishprint in (gha) =  metric tons of fish harvested per \nyear/productivity in metric tons per hectare \u00d7  weight-\ning factor\nBiocapacity in (gha) =  sustained yield of fish in metric \ntons per year/productivity in metric tons per hectare \u00d7 \nweighting factor\nThe following graph shows the earth\u2019s total fishprint \nand biocapacity between 1950 and 2000. Study it and an-swer the following questions. 1. Based on the graph,\n a. In what year did the global fishprint begin to ex-ceed the biological capacity of the world\u2019s oceans?\n b. By how much did the global fishprint exceed the biological capacity of the world\u2019s oceans in 2000?\n 2. Assume a country harvests 18 million metric tons of fish annually from an ocean area with an average productivity of 1.3 metric tons per hectare and a weighting factor of 2.68. What is the annual fishprint of that country?\n 3. If biologists determine that this country\u2019s sustained yield of fish is 17 million metric tons per year,\n a. What is the country\u2019s sustainable biological capacity?\n b. Is the county\u2019s annual fishing harvest sustainable?\n c.

People living in these  \nurban neighborhoods tend to rely on convenience stores and fast food restaurants that mainly offer high-calorie, highly pro-cessed foods that can lead to higher risks of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.\nWill Allen (Figure 10.1),  \none of six children of a share-cropper, grew up on a farm in Maryland, but left the farming life for college and a profes-sional basketball career, fol-lowed by a successful corporate marketing career. In 1993, Allen had decided to return to his  \nroots. He bought the last work-  \ning farm within the city limits of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and, in time, created a food oasis in a food desert.\nOn this small urban plot, Allen \ndeveloped Growing Power, Inc., an ecologically based farm and a show-case for forms of agriculture that apply all three scientific prin- ciples of sustainability.  It is  \npowered partly by solar electricity  \nand solar hot water systems and makes use of several greenhouses to capture solar energy for growing  \nfood throughout the year. The farm produces an amazing diversity of crops\u2014150 varieties of organic vege-tables along with organic herbs and sunflowers. It also produces organi-cally raised chickens, turkeys, goats, fish such as tilapia and perch, and honeybees. And the farm\u2019s nutrients are recycled in creative ways. For \nexample, wastes from the farmed fish are used as nutrients to raise some of the crops.\nThe farm\u2019s products are sold  \nlocally at Growing Power farm stands throughout the region and to various restaurants. Allen also worked with the city of Milwaukee to establish the Farm-to-City Market Basket program through which people can sign up for weekly deliveries of organic produce at modest prices.\nIn addition, Growing Power  \nruns an education program in which schoolchildren visit the farm and learn about where their food comes from. Allen also runs a training program for about 1,000 people every year who want to learn organic farming meth-ods. The farm has also partnered with the city of Milwaukee to create 150 new green jobs for unemployed and low-income workers, building green-houses, and growing food organically. Growing Power has expanded, locat-ing another urban farm in a neighbor -\nhood of Chicago, Illinois, and setting up satellite training sites in five other states.\nFor his creative and energetic \nefforts, Allen has won several presti-gious awards. However, he is most proud of the fact that his urban farm helps to feed more than 10,000 peo-ple every year and puts people to work raising good food.\nIn this chapter we look at  \ndifferent ways to produce food,  \nthe environmental effects of food  \nproduction, and how to produce  \nfood more sustainably.Growing Power\u2014An Urban Food Oasis\n216 \nFIGURE 10.1   In 1996, Will Allen founded Growing Power\u2014an urban farm in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Courtesy of Growing Power, Inc.\n90446_ch10_214-247.indd   216 8/13/14   8:42 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

More than 1 billion people work in agriculture to grow crops on about 38% of the earth\u2019s ice-free land. They produce more than enough food to meet the basic nutritional needs of every person on the earth. Despite this food surplus, one of every six people in the world is not getting enough to eat. These people face food insecurity\u2014living with chronic hunger and poor nutrition, which threatens their ability to lead healthy and productive lives (Concept 10.1A).\nMost agricultural experts agree that the root cause of food \ninsecurity is poverty, which prevents poor people from grow-ing or buying enough food to meet their needs. This is not surprising given that about half of the world\u2019s people are trying to survive on the equivalent of $2.25 a day and one out of six people struggle to get by on $1.25 a day.\nOther obstacles to food security are war, corruption, \npolitical upheaval, bad weather (such as prolonged drought, flooding, and heat waves), and climate change (Concept 10.1B). Another reason for food insecurity is that about 33% of the calories in the world\u2019s grain produc-tion are used to produce meat that many poor people can-not afford, 5% are used to produce biofuels for cars, and another 33% are wasted.\nEach day, there are about 232,000 more people at the \nworld\u2019s dinner tables and many of them will have little or no food on their plates. By 2050, there will likely be at least 2.6 billion more people to feed. This projected popu-lation increase will be more than twice China\u2019s current population and more than eight times the current U.S. population. Most of these people will live in the major cities of less-developed countries. A critical question is, how will we feed the projected 9.7 billion people in 2050 without causing serious harm to the environment? We explore possible answers to this question throughout this chapter.Many People Suffer from Chronic Hunger \nand Malnutrition\nTo maintain good health and resist disease, individuals \nneed fairly large amounts of macronutrients (such as carbo-hydrates, proteins, and fats) and smaller amounts of micro-nutrients\u2014vitamins, such as A, B, C, and E, and minerals such as iron, iodine, and calcium.\nPeople who cannot grow or buy enough food to meet \ntheir basic energy needs suffer from chronic undernutri-tion, or hunger (Concept 10.1A). Most of the world\u2019s hungry people live in low-income, less-developed coun-tries and typically can afford only a low-protein, high-carbohydrate, vegetarian diet consisting mainly of grains such as wheat, rice, and corn. In more-developed coun-tries, people living in food deserts (Core Case Study) have a similar problem, except that their diet is heavy on cheap food loaded with fats, sugar, and salt. In both cases, people often suffer from chronic malnutrition, a condition in which they do not get enough protein and other key nu-trients. This can weaken them, make them more vulner -\nable to disease, and hinder the normal physical and mental development of children.\nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture \nOrganization (FAO), there are about 1 billion chronically undernourished and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3821, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48b48627-47f6-4115-adc5-9467ab35a8cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "48b48627-47f6-4115-adc5-9467ab35a8cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "G.

According to the United Nations \n(UN), some 600 million people (almost twice the current U.S. population) suffer from goiter, most of them in less-developed countries. Also, 26 million children suffer irreversible brain damage every year from lack of iodine. The FAO and the WHO estimate that eliminating this serious health problem by adding traces of iodine to salt would cost the equivalent of only 2\u20133 cents per year for every person in the world.\nMany People Have Health Problems from \nEating Too Much\nOvernutrition occurs when food energy intake exceeds \nenergy use and causes excess body fat. Too many calories, too little exercise, or both can cause overnutrition. People who are underfed and underweight and those who are overfed and overweight share similar health problems: lower life expectancy, greater susceptibility to disease and illness, and lower productivity and life quality (Concept 10.1A).\nWe live in a world where, according to the WHO, \nabout 1 billion people face health problems because they do not get enough nutritious food to eat and another 1.6 billion have health problems because they eat too much. The WHO estimates that obesity contributes to the deaths of 2.8 million people per year.\nIn the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 69% of adults over age 20 and 33% of all children are overweight or obese. A 2013 study by Columbia University and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that obesity plays an important role in nearly one in five deaths in the United States from heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.10.2 HOW IS FOOD PRODUCED?\nCONCEPT 10.2   We have used high-input industrialized \nagriculture and lower-input traditional agriculture to greatly \nincrease food supplies.\nFood Production Has Increased \nDramatically\nThree systems supply most of the world\u2019s food. Croplands that \nproduce grains\u2014primarily rice, wheat, and corn\u2014provide about 77% of the world\u2019s food. The rest is provided by range-lands, pastures, and feedlots that produce meat and meat prod-ucts and fisheries and aquaculture (fish farming) that supply fish and shellfish. Since 1960, there has been a staggering increase in global food production from all three of the major food production systems (Concept 10.2).\nThese three systems depend on a small number of \nplant and animal species. About two out of three of the world\u2019s people survive primarily by eating three grain crops\u2014rice, wheat, and corn\u2014because they cannot afford to eat meat. Only a few species of mammals and fish provide most of the world\u2019s meat and seafood. (See Figure 14 in Supplement 5, p. S46, for a closer look at the loss of food diversity in the United States.)\nSuch food specialization puts us in a vulnerable position, \nshould any of the small number of crop strains, livestock breeds, and fish and shellfish species we depend on become depleted as a result of factors such as disease, environmental degradation, and climate change. This violates the biodiver -\nsity principle of sustainability, which calls for depending \non a variety of food sources as an ecological insurance pol-icy for dealing with changes in environmental condi-tions that have occurred throughout human history.\nIndustrialized Crop Production Relies on \nHigh-Input Monocultures\nThe two major types of agriculture are industrialized agri-\nculture and subsistence agriculture. Industrialized agri-culture, or high-input agriculture, uses heavy equipment along with large amounts of financial capital, fossil fuels, water, commercial inorganic fertilizers, and pesticides to produce single crops, or monocultures.

Traditional subsis-tence agriculture supplements energy from the sun with the labor of humans and draft animals to produce enough crops for a farm family\u2019s survival, with little left over to sell or store as a reserve for hard times. In traditional inten-sive agriculture, farmers try to obtain higher crop yields by increasing their inputs of human and draft-animal la-bor, animal manure for fertilizer, and water.\nSome traditional farmers focus on cultivating a single \ncrop, but many grow several crops on the same plot simul-taneously, a practice known as polyculture. This method relies on solar energy and natural fertilizers such as animal manure. The various crops mature at different times, pro-viding food throughout the year and keeping the topsoil covered to reduce erosion from wind and water. Polycul-ture also lessens the need for fertilizer and water because root systems at different depths in the soil capture nutri-ents and moisture efficiently.\nPolyculture is an application of the biodiversity \nprinciple of sustainability, because crop diversity GOOD\nNEWShelps protect and replenish the soil and reduces the chance \nof losing most or all of the year\u2019s food supply to pests, bad weather, and other misfortunes. Research shows that, on av-erage, low-input polyculture produces higher yields than does high-input industrialized monoculture, while using less energy and fewer resources and providing more food security for small landowners. For example, ecologists Peter Reich and David Tilman found that carefully controlled poly-culture plots with 16 different species of plants consistently out-produced plots with 9, 4, or only 1 type of plant species.\nSuch research explains why some analysts argue for \ngreatly expanding the use of polyculture to produce food more sustainably.

Growing Power (Core Case Study) has become a well-known model for such food production.

About 13,000 of the 2.2 million farms in the United States are USDA certified organic. Products la-beled organic must contain at least 95% organic ingredi-\nents and those labeled made with organic ingredients must contain at least 70% organic ingredients. The word natural \nis used on food labels primarily as an advertising ploy.\nA Closer Look at Industrialized  \nCrop Production\nFarmers have two ways to produce more food: farming \nmore land or getting higher yields from existing cropland. Since 1950, about 88% of the increase in global grain pro-duction has come from using high-input industrialized agriculture to increase crop yields. This process, called the green revolution, involves three steps. First, develop and plant monocultures of selectively bred or genetically engi-neered varieties of key grain crops such as rice, wheat, and corn. Second, produce high yields by using large inputs of \nwater, synthetic inorganic fertilizers, and pesticides. Third, increase the number of crops grown per year on a plot of land through multiple cropping.\nBetween 1950 and 1970, in what was called the first \ngreen revolution, this high-input approach dramatically raised crop yields in most of the world\u2019s more-developed countries, especially the United States (see the Case Study that follows). In the second green revolution, which began in 1967, fast-growing varieties of rice and wheat, specially bred for tropical and subtropical climates, were introduced into middle-income, less-developed countries, including India, China, and Brazil.\nLargely because of the two green revolutions, between \n1950 and 2012, world grain production (Figure 10.4, left) increased by 72% and per capita grain production (Figure 10.4, right) grew by 28%. The world\u2019s three largest grain-producing countries\u2014China, India, and the United States\u2014produce almost half of the world\u2019s grains.\nPeople directly consume about 46% of the world\u2019s \ngrain production. Most of the rest is fed to livestock and thus is consumed by people who can afford to eat meat and meat products and to purchase biofuels such as etha-nol and biodiesel. In 2012, for example, about 40% of the U.S. corn crop was used to produce biofuels (mostly \n energy-inefficient ethanol).\nCASE STUDY\nIndustrialized Food Production in the \nUnited States\nIn the United States, industrialized farming has evolved \ninto agribusiness, as a small number of giant multinational \ncorporations increasingly control the growing, processing, distribution, and sale of food in U.S. and global markets. Since 1960, U.S. industrialized agriculture has more than doubled the yields of key crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans without the need for cultivating more land. Such yield increases have kept large areas of U.S. forests, grasslands, and wetlands from being converted to farmland.\nHowever, if we view productivity not as the yield per \narea of land but as the number of people fed per area of land, then China and India are more productive than the United States, according to research by the ETS Group. This has occurred because about 38% of the grain pro-duced in the United States is used to feed livestock for meat production and to produce biofuels for cars.\nLow-income people in less-developed countries typi-\ncally spend 50% to 70% of their income on food, accord-ing to 2012 data from the FAO.

By contrast, because of the efficiency of U.S. agriculture, Americans spend the lowest percent-age of disposable income in the world\u2014an average of 7%\u2014on food.\nHowever, because of a number of hidden costs related to \ntheir food production and consumption, most American consumers are not aware that their actual food costs are much higher than the market prices they pay. Such hid-den costs include taxes to pay for farm subsidies, or govern-ment payments intended to help farmers stay in business and increase their yields. (Most subsidies go to producers of corn, wheat, soybeans, and rice.) Hidden costs also in-clude the costs of pollution, environmental degradation, and higher health insurance bills related to the harmful environmental and health effects of industrialized agricul-ture (discussed in the next section). As food expert Mi-chael Pollan puts it, \u201cThere is no such thing as cheap food. The real cost of food is paid somewhere. . . . if it isn\u2019t paid at the cash register, it\u2019s charged to the environment or to the public purse in the form of subsidies. And it\u2019s charged to your health.\u201d\nCrossbreeding and Genetic Engineering \nProduce New Varieties of Crops  and Livestock\nFor centuries, farmers and scientists have used crossbreed-\ning through artificial selection to develop genetically im-proved varieties of crops and livestock animals. Such selective breeding in this first gene revolution has yielded amazing results. For example, ancient ears of corn were about the size of your little finger, and wild tomatoes were once the size of grapes, but most of the large varieties used now were selectively bred.\nTraditional crossbreeding is a slow process, typically \ntaking 15 years or more to produce a commercially valu-able new crop variety, and it can combine traits only from species that are genetically similar. Typically, resulting va-rieties remain useful for only 5\u201310 years before pests and diseases reduce their yields. Important advances are still being made with this method.\nToday, scientists are creating a second gene revolution by \nusing genetic engineering to develop genetically modified \nstrains of crops and livestock animals. Engineers use a process called gene splicing to alter an organism\u2019s genetic material through adding, deleting, or changing segments of its DNA. The goal of this process is to add desirable traits or to eliminate undesirable ones by enabling scientists to transfer genes between different species that would not normally interbreed in nature. The resulting organisms are called genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\nCompared to traditional crossbreeding, developing a \nnew crop variety through gene splicing takes about half as long, usually costs less, and allows for the insertion of genes from almost any other organism into crop or animal cells. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), at least 80% of the food products on U.S. supermarket shelves contain some form of genetically engineered food or ingredients, and that proportion is growing.\nGlobally, 61 countries require the labeling of food with \ngenetically modified ingredients. In the United States, fed-eral laws do not require such labeling, even though polls indicate that 90% of the public wants to have such informa-tion included on food labels. This is largely because some seed and food companies have lobbied the U.S. Congress and state legislatures to oppose GMO food labeling. Foods labeled 100 percent organic or USDA Certified Organic can make \nno use of genetically modified seeds or ingredients.\nIn 2013, the citizens of Washington state approved a \nmeasure to require the labeling of food with genetically modified ingredients. In 2014, the food industry was fighting such labeling by proposing voluntary national labeling with the provision that no state could mandate such labeling.

They also hope to develop crop plants that can grow faster and survive with little or no irrigation and with less use of fertilizer and pesticides. Some scientists contend that such innovations hold great promise for helping to improve global food security. Others warn that genetic engineering is not free of drawbacks, which we examine later in this chapter.\nMeat Consumption Has Grown Steadily\nMeat and animal products such as eggs and milk are sources of high-quality protein and represent the world\u2019s second major food-producing system. Between 1961 and 2012, according to the FAO, production of meat and meat products\u2014mostly beef, pork, poultry, mutton, milk, cheese, and eggs\u2014increased more than twofold and the average consumption per person of meat and meat prod-ucts more than doubled. Global meat consumption is likely to more than double again by 2050 as incomes rise and millions of people in rapidly developing countries move up the food chain and consume more meat and meat products every year. For example, meat consump-tion in China increased ninefold between 1978 and 2013.\nAbout half of the world\u2019s meat comes from livestock \ngrazing on grass in unfenced rangelands and enclosed pas-tures. The other half is produced through an industrialized factory farm system. It involves raising large numbers of animals bred to gain weight quickly, mostly in crowded feedlots (Figure 10.5) or in very crowded pens and cages in huge buildings called concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) (Figure 10.6).\n90446_ch10_214-247.indd   221 8/13/14   8:42 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

A fishery is a concentration of particular aquatic species suitable for commercial harvest-ing in a given ocean area or inland body of water. Indus-trial fishing fleets harvest most of the world\u2019s marine catch of wild fish by using a variety of methods (see Figure 9.24, p. 207).\n Fish and shellfish are also produced through \naquaculture or fish farming\u2014the practice of raising fish in freshwater ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and rice paddies, and in underwater cages in coastal and deeper ocean waters.\nBetween 1950 and 2012, global seafood production of \nwild and farmed fish increased ninefold (Concept 10.2). In 2012, about 58% of the world\u2019s fish and shellfish were caught mostly by industrial fishing fleets and 42% were produced through aquaculture\u2014the world\u2019s fastest-growing type of food production (Figure 10.7). In 2011, farmed fish production topped beef production, with China account-ing for 62% of the world total. According to a 2012 report on world fisheries by the FAO, about 87% of the world\u2019s commercial ocean fisheries are being harvested at full ca-pacity (57%) or overfished (30%).\nMost of the world\u2019s aquaculture involves raising species \nthat feed on algae or other plants\u2014mainly carp in China and India, catfish in the United States, tilapia in several In these facilities, the animals are fed grain, soybeans, \nfishmeal, or fish oil, and some of this feed is doctored with growth hormones and antibiotics to accelerate livestock growth. Because of the crowding, animal wastes and run-off from feedlots and CAFOs can have serious impacts on the air and water, which we examine later in this chapter.\nFIGURE 10.6  Concentrated chicken feeding operation in Iowa \n(USA).

Such species are often fed fishmeal and fish oil produced from other fish and their wastes, al-though by 2014, this practice had declined slightly.\nIndustrialized Food Production Requires \nHuge Inputs of Energy\nThe industrialization of food production has been made \npossible by using fossil fuels\u2014mostly oil and natural gas\u2014to run farm machinery and fishing vessels, to pump irriga-tion water for crops, and to produce synthetic pesticides (mostly from petrochemicals produced when oil is re-fined) and synthetic inorganic fertilizers. Fossil fuels are also used to process food and transport it long distances within and between countries. Agriculture uses about 20% of all the energy used in the United States, where food items travel an average of 2,400 kilometers (1,300 miles) from farm to plate.\nWhen we consider the energy used to grow, store, pro-\ncess, package, transport, refrigerate, and cook all plant and animal food, it takes about 10 units of fossil fuel energy to put 1 unit of food energy on the table in the United States. Also, according to a study led by ecological economist Peter Tyedmers, the world\u2019s fishing fleets use about 12.5 units of energy to put 1 unit of food energy from seafood on the table. In other words, today\u2019s systems for producing, pro-cessing, transporting, and preparing food are highly depen-dent on fossil fuels, and together, they result in a large net energy loss.\nOn the other hand, the amount of energy per calorie \nused to produce crops in the United States has declined by about 50% since the 1970s. One factor in this decline is that the amount of energy used to produce synthetic ni-trogen fertilizer has dropped sharply. Another is the rising use of conservation tillage, which sharply reduces energy use and the harmful environmental effects of plowing, as is explained further in the next section of this chapter.\n10.3 WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL \nPROBLEMS ARISE FROM INDUSTRIALIZED FOOD PRODUCTION?\nCONCEPT 10.3   Future food production may be limited by \nsoil erosion and degradation, desertification, irrigation wa-\nter shortages, air and water pollution, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.\nProducing Food Has Major  \nEnvironmental Impacts\nIndustrialized agriculture has allowed farmers to use less \nland to produce more food, and this has helped to protect biodiversity in many areas by reducing the destruction of forests and grasslands for farming. However, many ana-lysts point out that industrialized agriculture has greater overall harmful environmental impacts (Figure 10.8) than any other human activity and that these environmental effects may limit future food production (Concept 10.3).\nAccording to a 2010 study by 27 experts assembled by \nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), ag-riculture uses massive amounts of the world\u2019s resources. It accounts for about 70% of the freshwater removed from aquifers and surface waters, worldwide. It also uses about 38% of the world\u2019s ice-free land, emits about 25% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and produces about 60% of all water pollution. As a result, many analysts view today\u2019s industrialized agriculture as environmentally and economically unsustainable, in the long run. However, proponents of industrialized agriculture argue that its ben-efits outweigh its harmful effects.\nTopsoil Erosion Is a Serious Problem in \nParts of the World\nSoil is literally the foundation of life on land (Science Fo-\ncus 10.1).

Question:  \nCan you see any geographical pattern associated with this problem?\nCompiled by the authors using data from the UN Environ-\nment Programme and the World Resources Institute.However, topsoil can erode when we remove soil-holding \ngrasses, trees, and other vegetation through activities such as farming (see Figure 7.13, p. 141), deforestation (see Fig-ure 9.7, p. 190), and overgrazing (see Figure 9.15, p. 196). A joint survey by the UNEP and the World Resources Insti-tute indicated that topsoil is eroding faster than it forms on about one-third of the world\u2019s cropland (Figure 10.11). (See the online Guest Essay on soil erosion by David Pimentel.)\nErosion of topsoil has three major harmful effects. One \nis loss of soil fertility through depletion of plant nutrients in \ntopsoil. A second effect is water pollution in surface waters where eroded topsoil ends up as sediment, which can kill fish and shellfish and clog irrigation ditches, boat channels, reservoirs, and lakes. Additional water pollution occurs when the eroded sediment contains pesticide residues that can be ingested by aquatic organisms and in some cases biomagnified within food webs (see Figure 8.9, p. 171). Third, erosion releases carbon that was stored in the soil by vegetation into the air and water, thus altering the car -\nbon cycle and adding to atmospheric levels of carbon diox-ide (CO\n2).\nThe rise of industrialized agriculture has exposed irre-\nplaceable topsoil to erosion by water and wind and reduced the plant nutrient content of topsoil in many areas. This erosion of soil nutrients from topsoil, and from synthetic chemical fertilizers added to the soil, sends the nutrients on a one-way trip to crops and then to nearby bodies of sur -\nface water, which often become overloaded with plant nutrients. The continuing disruption of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles (see Figures 3.15 and 3.16, pp. 54 and 55), due to the loss of topsoil and depletion of its key nu-trients, is another factor that could eventually make indus-trialized agriculture unsustainable (Concept 10.3).\nSoil pollution is also a problem in parts of the world. \nSome of the chemicals emitted into the atmosphere by industrial and power plants and by motor vehicles can pol-lute soil and water used to irrigate soil. Pesticides can also contaminate soil.\nIn 2014, China\u2019s environment ministry reported on a \n4-year survey finding that 19% of China\u2019s arable (farm-able) land is contaminated, especially with toxic metals such as cadmium, arsenic, and nickel, and that about 2.5% of the country\u2019s cropland is too contaminated to grow food safely. China, with 19% of the world\u2019s people and only 7% of the world\u2019s arable land, cannot afford to lose 2.5% of its cropland.\nFIGURE 10.10   Wind is an important cause of topsoil erosion in dry \nareas that are not covered by vegetation such as this bare crop field \nin the U.S. state of Iowa.\nLynn Betts/USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service\n90446_ch10_214-247.indd   225 8/13/14   8:42 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Soil formation be-gins when bedrock is slowly broken down into fragments and particles by physical, chemical, and biological pro-cesses, called weathering. Figure 10.A shows profiles of different-aged soils.\nSoil, on which all terrestrial life de-\npends, is one of the most important components of the earth\u2019s natural capi-tal. It supplies most of the nutrients needed for plant growth and purifies and stores water. Organisms living in the soil remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it as organic carbon compounds, thereby helping to control the earth\u2019s climate as part of the carbon cycle (see Figure 3.14,  \np. 53).\n You might think of topsoil as \nsomething found only in farm fields, but it underlies all forests and grass-lands, as well as croplands.\nMost soils that have developed over \nlong periods of time, called mature soils,  \ncontain horizontal layers, or horizons  \n(Figure 10.A), each with a distinct texture and composition that vary with different types of soils. Most mature soils have at least three of the four possible horizons.\nThe roots of most \nplants and the majority of a soil\u2019s organic matter are concentrated in the soil\u2019s two upper layers, the O horizon  \nof leaf litter and the A horizon of top-soil. In healthy soils, these two layers teem with bacteria, fungi, earthworms, and small insects, all interacting in complex food webs. Bacteria and other decomposer microorganisms, found by the billions in every handful of topsoil, break down some of the soil\u2019s complex organic compounds into a mixture of the partially decomposed bodies of dead plants and animals, called humus,  \nand inorganic materials such as clay, silt, and sand. Soil moisture carrying these dissolved nutrients is drawn up by the roots of plants and transported through their stems and into their leaves as a key component of chemical cycling, the basis for one of the  \nprinciples of sustainability.\nThe B horizon (subsoil) and the C \nhorizon (parent material) contain most of a soil\u2019s inorganic matter, mostly broken-down rock consisting of varying mixtures of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. Much of it is transported by water from the A horizon. The C horizon lies \non a base of parent material, which is often bedrock.\nThe spaces, or pores, between the \nsolid organic and inorganic particles in the upper and lower soil layers contain varying amounts of air (mostly nitrogen and oxygen gas) and water. Plant roots use the oxygen for cellular respiration. As long as the O and A horizons are anchored by vegetation, the soil layers as a whole act as a sponge, storing water and nutrients, and releasing them in a nourishing trickle.\nAlthough topsoil is a renewable re-\nsource, it is renewed very slowly, which means it can be depleted. Just 1 centi-meter (0.4 inch) of topsoil can take hundreds of years to form, but it can be washed or blown away in a matter of weeks or months when we plow grassland or clear a forest and leave its topsoil unprotected.\nCritical Thinking\nHow does soil contribute to each of the four components of biodiversity described in Figure 4.2 (p. 65)?ScienceFocus10.1\nANIMATED FIGURE 10.A   \nGeneralized soil profile  \nand formation of soil.  \nQuestions: What role do \nyou think the tree in this \n figure plays in soil forma-tion?

Only in extreme cases does desertification lead to what we call desert.\nOver thousands of years, the earth\u2019s deserts have ex-\npanded and contracted, primarily because of climate change. However, human use of the land, especially for agricul-tural purposes, has increased desertification in some parts of the world mostly because of deforestation, excessive plowing, and overgrazing that leave the topsoil bare and unprotected against erosion by flowing water and wind.\nExcessive Irrigation Has  \nSerious Consequences\nA major reason for the success of farmers in boosting pro-\nductivity on farms is the use of irrigation, which accounts for about 70% of the water that humanity uses. Currently, the 20% of the world\u2019s cropland that is irrigated produces about 40% of the world\u2019s food.\nHowever, irrigation has a downside. Most irrigation \nwater is a dilute solution of various salts, such as sodium chloride, that are picked up as the water flows over or through soil and rocks. Irrigation water that is not ab-sorbed into the topsoil evaporates and leaves behind a thin crust of dissolved mineral salts in the topsoil. Repeated applications of irrigation water in dry climates lead to the gradual accumulation of salts in the upper soil layers\u2014a soil degradation process called soil salinization. It stunts crop growth, lowers crop yields, and can eventually kill plants and ruin the land.\nThe FAO estimates that severe soil salinization has re-\nduced yields on at least 10% of the world\u2019s irrigated crop-land, and that by 2020, 30% of the world\u2019s arable land will be salty. Salinization affects almost one-fourth of irrigated cropland in the United States, especially in western states (Figure 10.13).\nFIGURE 10.12   Severe \nsoil erosion due to over -\ngrazing by cattle has led \nto desertification.\nDick Ercken/Shutterstock.com\nFIGURE 10.13   Natural capital degradation: White alkaline salts have \ndisplaced crops that once grew on this heavily irrigated land in the U.S. state of Colorado.USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service\n90446_ch10_214-247.indd   227 8/13/14   8:42 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Waterlogging lowers the productivity of crop plants and kills them after prolonged exposure, because it deprives plants of the oxy-gen they need to survive. At least 10% of the world\u2019s ir -\nrigated land suffers from this worsening problem, according to the FAO.\nAgriculture Contributes to Air Pollution \nand Climate Change\nAgricultural activities, including the clearing and burning \nof forests to raise crops or livestock, create a great deal of air pollution. They also account for more than a quarter of all human-generated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO\n2), \nwhich is helping to warm the atmosphere and lead to cli-mate change that is projected to play an important role in making some areas unsuitable for growing crops during this century.\nAccording to the 2006 FAO study, Livestock\u2019s Long \nShadow, industrialized livestock production generates about 18% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases\u2014more than all of the world\u2019s cars, trucks, buses, and planes emit. In particular, cattle and dairy cows release methane (CH\n4)\u2014a \ngreenhouse gas with about 25 times the warming potential of CO\n2 per molecule\u2014mostly through belching. Along \nwith the methane generated by liquid animal manure stored in feedlot waste lagoons, this accounts for about 18% of the global annual emissions of methane. And ni-trous oxide (N\n2O), with about 300 times the atmospheric \nwarming capacity of CO 2 per molecule, is released in huge \nquantities by synthetic inorganic fertilizers, as well as by livestock manure.\nFood and Biofuel Production Systems Have \nCaused Major Losses of Biodiversity\nNatural biodiversity and some ecosystem services are \nthreatened when tropical and other forests are cleared (see Figure 9.9, p. 191) and when grasslands are plowed up and replaced with croplands used to produce food and biofuels (Concept 10.3).\nFor example, one of the fastest-growing threats to the \nworld\u2019s biodiversity is the cutting or burning of large areas of tropical forest in Brazil\u2019s Amazon Basin and the clearing of areas of its cerrado, a huge tropical grassland region south of the Amazon Basin. This land is being burned or cleared for cattle ranches, large plantations of soybeans grown for cattle feed (see Figure 1.4, p. 8), and sugarcane used for making ethanol fuel. In Indonesia, tropical forests are burned to make way for plantations of oil palm trees increasingly used to produce biodiesel fuel.A related problem is the increasing loss of agrobiodi-\nversity\u2014the genetic variety of animal and plant species used on farms to produce food. Scientists estimate that since 1900, we have lost 75% of the genetic diversity of agricultural crops that existed then. For example, India once planted 30,000 varieties of rice. Now more than 75% of its rice production comes from only ten varieties and soon, almost all of its production might come from just one or two varieties. In the United States, about 97% of the food plant varieties available to farmers in the 1940s no longer exist, except perhaps in small amounts in seed banks and in the backyards of a few gardeners (see Figure 14, p. S46, in Supplement 5).\nIn losing agrobiodiversity, ecologists warn that we are \nrapidly shrinking the world\u2019s genetic \u201clibrary\u201d of plant va-rieties, which are critical for increasing food yields. This failure to preserve agrobiodiversity is a serious violation of the biodiversity principle of", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3698, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3c96b1b-280b-4248-ae60-eb2483c24bc4": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3c96b1b-280b-4248-ae60-eb2483c24bc4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "228", "file_name": "G.

How-ever, power failures, fires, storms, wars, and unintentional disposal of seeds can cause irreversible losses of these stored plants and seeds. The world\u2019s most secure seed bank is the underground Doomsday Seed Vault, which was carved into the Arctic permafrost on a frozen Norwegian arctic island (Figure 10.14). It is being stocked with dupli-cates of much of the world\u2019s seed collections.\nHowever, the seeds of many plants cannot be stored \nsuccessfully in seed banks. Because stored seeds do not re-main alive indefinitely, they must be planted and germi-nated periodically, and new seeds must be collected for storage. Unless this is done, seed banks become seed morgues.\nThere Is Controversy over Genetically \nEngineered Foods\nWhile genetic engineering could help to improve food se-\ncurity for some, controversy has arisen over the use of this technology. Its producers and investors see genetically modified (GM) food production as a potentially sustain-able way to solve world hunger problems. However, some critics consider it potentially dangerous \u201cFrankenfood\u201d that would allow a small number of seed companies to patent genetically modified crops and control most of the world\u2019s food production, and thus food prices. Figure 10.15 summarizes the major projected benefits and draw-backs of this new technology.\nSome critics recognize the potential benefits of GM \ncrops (Figure 10.15, left) but they point out that most of the GM crops developed so far have provided very few of these benefits.

It calls into serious question industry claims that ge-netic engineering will increase crop yields, lessen the need for pesticides, and yield drought-tolerant crops. The report also summarized findings indicating that GM crops with built-in toxins, such as Bt toxins, widely used to fend off insects in corn production, could threaten human health by triggering an inflammatory response leading to diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. In addition, herbicide-resistant genetically engineered crops have led to increased herbicide use and to herbicide-resistant superweeds, some of which can rapidly grow more than 2 meters (7 feet) tall.\nThe Ecological Society of America and various critics of \ngenetically engineered crops call for more controlled field experiments and long-term testing, to better understand the ecological and health risks, and stricter regulation of this rapidly growing technology.There Are Limits to Expansion of the Green \nRevolutions\nSo far, several factors have limited the success of the green \nrevolutions and may limit them even more in the future (Concept 10.3). For example, without large inputs of wa-ter and synthetic inorganic fertilizers and pesticides, most green revolution and genetically engineered crop varieties produce yields that are no higher (and are sometimes lower) than those from traditional strains. These high in-puts also cost too much for most subsistence farmers in less-developed countries.\nScientists point out that where such inputs do increase \nyields, there comes a point where yields stop growing be-cause of the inability of crop plants to take up nutrients from additional fertilizer and irrigation water. This helps to explain the slowdown in the rate of growth in global grain yields since 1990.\nCan we expand the green revolutions by irrigating \nmore cropland? Since 1978, the amount of irrigated land per person has been declining, and it is projected to fall much more by 2050. One reason for this is population growth, which is projected to add 2.6 billion more people between 2013 and 2050. Other factors are limited avail-ability of irrigation water, soil salinization, and the fact that most of the world\u2019s farmers do not have enough money to irrigate their crops. In addition, projected climate change during this century is likely to melt some of the mountain glaciers that provide irrigation and drinking water for many millions of people in China, India, and South America.

We have already cleared or converted about 38% of \nthe world\u2019s ice-free land surface for use as croplands and pastures. By clearing tropical forests and irrigating arid land, we could more than double the area of the world\u2019s cropland. The problem is that such massive clearing of forests would speed up climate change and increase topsoil erosion and biodiversity losses. Also, much of this land has poor soil fertility, steep slopes, or both, and cultivating such land would be expensive and probably not ecologi-cally sustainable.\nIn addition, during this century, fertile croplands in \ncoastal areas, including many of the major rice-growing floodplains and river deltas in Asia, are likely to be flooded by rising sea levels resulting from projected climate change. Food production could also drop sharply in some major food-producing areas because of longer and more intense droughts and heat waves, also resulting from projected climate change.\nIndustrialized Meat Production Has \nHarmful Environmental Effects\nProponents of industrialized meat production point out \nthat it has increased meat supplies, reduced overgrazing, and kept food prices down. But feedlots (Figure 10.5) and concentrated animal feeding operations (Figure 10.6) use large amounts of water to grow feed for livestock and to wash away their wastes. In his book The Food Revolution, John Robbins estimated that \u201cyou\u2019d save more water by not eating a pound of California beef than you would by not showering for a year.\u201d\nAnalysts also point out that meat produced by indus-\ntrialized agriculture is artificially cheap because most of its harmful environmental and health costs are not included in the market prices of meat and meat products, a viola-tion of the full-cost pricing principle of sustainabil-ity. Figure 10.16 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of industrialized meat production.\nIn 2008, the FAO reported that overgrazing and ero-\nsion by livestock had degraded about 20% of the world\u2019s grasslands and pastures. The same report estimated that rangeland grazing and industrialized livestock production caused about 55% of all topsoil erosion and sediment pol-lution, and fully one-third of the water pollution resulting from the runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from exces-sive inputs of synthetic fertilizers.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Meat Production and Ocean  \nDead Zones\nHuge amounts of synthetic inorganic fertilizers are used in the Midwestern \nUnited States to produce corn for animal feed and ethanol fuel for cars. Much of this fertilizer runs off cropland and eventually goes into the Mississippi River. The added nitrate and phosphate nutrients over-fertilize coastal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, where the river flows into the ocean. \neach year, this creates a \n\u201cdead zone\u201d often larger than the U.S. state of Massachusetts. This oxygen-depleted zone threatens one-fifth of the nation\u2019s seafood yield. \nin other words, \ngrowing corn in the Midwest, largely to feed cattle and fuel cars, degrades aquatic biodiversity and seafood production in the Gulf of Mexico.\nIndustrialized meat production uses large amounts of \nenergy (mostly from oil), which helps to make it one of the \nchief sources of air and water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Working Group has es-timated that production of meat and meat products gener -\nates 10\u201320 times more greenhouse gases per unit of weight than does production of common vegetables and grains.\nAnother growing problem is the use of antibiotics in \nindustrialized livestock production facilities.

Globally, only about half of all manure is returned to the land as nutrient-rich fertilizer\u2014a violation of the chemical cycling principle of sustainability. Much of the other half ends up polluting aquatic systems, producing foul odors, and emitting large quantities of climate-changing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\nAquaculture Can Harm Aquatic Ecosystems\nFigure 10.17 lists the major benefits and drawbacks of aqua-culture, which in 2012 accounted for about 42% of all seafood produced for human consumption. Some analysts warn that the harmful environmental effects of aquaculture could limit its future production potential (Concept 10.3).\nOne major environmental problem associated with \naquaculture is that about a third of the wild fish caught from the oceans are used to make the fishmeal and fish oil that are to fed to farmed fish. This is contributing to the depletion of many populations of wild fish that are crucial to marine food webs\u2014a serious threat to marine biodiver -\nsity and ecosystem services.\nAnother problem is that some fishmeal and fish oil fed \nto farm-raised fish is contaminated with long-lived toxins such as PCBs and dioxins that are picked up from the ocean floor. Aquaculture producers contend that the con-centrations of these chemicals are not high enough to threaten human health, but some scientists disagree. Fish farms, especially those that raise carnivorous fish such as salmon and tuna, also produce large amounts of wastes, including pesticides and antibiotics used on fish farms. Yet another problem is that farmed fish can escape their pens and mix with wild fish, possibly disrupting the gene pools of wild populations.\nMajor seed companies are now pushing to use pat-\nented, genetically modified soybeans as the primary feed for farm-raised fish and shellfish. This could increase water pollution because fish that are fed soy tend to produce more waste than those that are not fed soy. It would also give a small number of seed companies control over much of the world\u2019s seafood production, along with seafood prices. And it could encourage more deforestation and loss of biodiversity wherever soy plantations replace tropical forests (see Figure 1.4, p. 8).\n10.4 HOW CAN WE PROTECT  \nCROPS FROM PESTS  MORE SUSTAINABLY?\nCONCEPT 10.4   We can sharply cut pesticide use without \ndecreasing crop yields by using a mix of cultivation tech-\nniques, biological pest controls, and small amounts of se-lected chemical pesticides as a last resort (integrated pest management).\nNature Controls the Populations  \nof Most Pests\nA pest is any species that interferes with human welfare \nby competing with us for food, invading our homes, \nlawns, or gardens, destroying building materials, spreading disease, invading ecosystems, or simply being a nuisance. Worldwide, only about 100 species of plants (weeds), ani-mals (mostly insects), fungi, and microbes cause most of the damage to the crops we grow.\nIn natural ecosystems and in many polyculture crop \nfields, natural enemies (predators, parasites, and disease \norganisms) control the populations of most potential pest species. This free ecosystem service is an important part of the earth\u2019s natural capital. For example, biologists estimate that the world\u2019s 30,000 known species of spiders kill far more crop-eating insects every year than humans do by using insecticides. Most spiders, including the wolf spider (Figure 10.18), do not harm humans.\nWhen we clear forests and grasslands, plant monocul-\nture crops, and douse fields with chemicals that kill pests, we upset many of these natural population checks and balances that are in keeping with the biodiversity principle of sustainability.

In his book The Food Revolution, John Robbins estimated that \u201cyou\u2019d save more water by not eating a pound of California beef than you would by not showering for a year.\u201d\nAnalysts also point out that meat produced by indus-\ntrialized agriculture is artificially cheap because most of its harmful environmental and health costs are not included in the market prices of meat and meat products, a viola-tion of the full-cost pricing principle of sustainabil-ity. Figure 10.16 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of industrialized meat production.\nIn 2008, the FAO reported that overgrazing and ero-\nsion by livestock had degraded about 20% of the world\u2019s grasslands and pastures. The same report estimated that rangeland grazing and industrialized livestock production caused about 55% of all topsoil erosion and sediment pol-lution, and fully one-third of the water pollution resulting from the runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from exces-sive inputs of synthetic fertilizers.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Meat Production and Ocean  \nDead Zones\nHuge amounts of synthetic inorganic fertilizers are used in the Midwestern \nUnited States to produce corn for animal feed and ethanol fuel for cars. Much of this fertilizer runs off cropland and eventually goes into the Mississippi River. The added nitrate and phosphate nutrients over-fertilize coastal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, where the river flows into the ocean. each year, this creates a \u201cdead zone\u201d often larger than the U.S. state of Massachusetts. This oxygen-depleted zone threatens one-fifth of the nation\u2019s seafood yield. in other words, growing corn in the Midwest, largely to feed cattle and fuel cars, degrades aquatic biodiversity and seafood production in the Gulf of Mexico.\nIndustrialized meat production uses large amounts of \nenergy (mostly from oil), which helps to make it one of the \nchief sources of air and water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Working Group has es-timated that production of meat and meat products gener -\nates 10\u201320 times more greenhouse gases per unit of weight than does production of common vegetables and grains.\nAnother growing problem is the use of antibiotics in \nindustrialized livestock production facilities. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimated that about 80% of all antibiotics sold in the United States (and 50% of those in the world) are added to animal feed. This is done to try to prevent the spread of diseases in crowded feedlots and CAFOs and to promote the growth of the ani-mals before they are slaughtered. According to FDA data and several studies, this plays a role in the rise of genetic resistance among many disease-causing bacteria (see Fig-ure 4.9, p. 74).\n Such resistance can reduce the effective-\nness of some antibiotics used to treat humans for bacterial infections, and it can promote the development of new, more genetically resistant infectious disease organisms.\nFinally, according to the USDA, animal waste produced \nby the American meat industry amounts to about 130 times \nAquaculture\nUse of fish oil and \nfishmeal on fish farms depletes wild fisheries\nLarge waste outputLoss of mangrove \nforests and estuaries\nDense populations \nvulnerable to diseaseHigh efficiency\nHigh yieldReduces over- \nharvesting of fisheries\nJobs and profitsAdvantages Disadvantages Trade-Offs\nFIGURE 10.17   Use of aquaculture has advantages and disadvan-\ntages.

Common types of pesticides include insecticides (insect killers), herbicides (weed killers), \nfungicides (fungus killers), and rodenticides (rat and mouse \nkillers).\nWe did not invent the use of chemicals to repel or kill \nother species. For nearly 225 million years, plants have been producing chemicals to ward off, deceive, or poison the insects and herbivores that feed on them. Scientists have used such chemicals to create biopesticides to kill some pests. This battle produces a never-ending, ever-changing coevolutionary process: insects and herbivores overcome various plant defenses through natural selection and new plant defenses are favored by natural selection.\nSince 1950, synthetic pesticide use has increased more \nthan 50-fold and most of today\u2019s pesticides are 10\u2013100 times more toxic to pests than those used in the 1950s. Some synthetic pesticides, called broad-spectrum agents, are \ntoxic to beneficial species as well as to pests. Examples are organochlorine compounds (such as DDT), organophos-phates (such as malathion and parathion), carbamates, pyrethroids, and neonicotinoids. Others, called selective, or narrow-spectrum, agents, are each effective against a nar -\nrowly defined group of organisms. Examples are chitins that inhibit the molting process of insects, juvenile hor -\nmones that disrupt the life cycle of insects, and fungicides.Pesticides vary in their persistence, the length of time \nthey remain deadly in the environment. Some, such as DDT and related compounds, remain in the environment for years and can be biologically magnified in food chains and webs (see Figure 8.9, p. 171).\n Others, such as organo-\nphosphates, are active for days or weeks and are not bio-logically magnified but can be highly toxic to humans.\nAbout one-fourth of the pesticides used in the United \nStates are aimed at ridding houses, gardens, lawns, parks, playing fields, swimming pools, and golf courses of insects and other species that we view as pests. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of synthetic pesticides used on the average U.S. home-owner\u2019s lawn is ten times the amount (per unit of land area) typically used on U.S. croplands.\nSynthetic Pesticides Provide  \nSeveral Benefits\nUse of synthetic pesticides has its advantages and disadvan-\ntages. Proponents contend that the benefits of pesticides (Figure 10.19, left) outweigh their harmful effects (Figure 10.19, right). They point to the following benefits:\n\u2022\tThey have saved human lives. Since 1945, DDT and other \ninsecticides probably have prevented the premature deaths of at least 7 million people (some say as many as 500 million) from insect-transmitted diseases such as malaria (carried by the Anopheles mosquito), bubonic plague (carried by rat fleas), and typhus (carried by body lice and fleas).\n\u2022\tThey can increase food supplies by reducing food losses due to pests.\n\u2022\tThey can help farmers to increase their profits.

Pesticides control most pests quickly, have a long shelf life, and are easily shipped and applied.\n\u2022\tWhen used properly, the health risks of some pesticides are very low, relative to their benefits, according to some scientific studies.\n\u2022\tNewer pesticides are safer to use and more effective than many older ones. Greater use is being made of chemicals derived originally from plants (biopesticides), which are generally safer to use and less damaging to the environment than are many older pesticides. Genetic engineering is also being used to develop pest-resistant crop strains and genetically altered crops that produce biopesticides.\nSynthetic Pesticides Have  \nSeveral Drawbacks\nOpponents of widespread use of synthetic pesticides con-\ntend that the harmful effects of these chemicals outweigh their benefits. They cite several problems.\n\u2022\tThey accelerate the development of genetic resistance to \npesticides in pest organisms. Insects breed rapidly, and within 5\u201310 years (much sooner in tropical areas), they can develop immunity to widely used pesticides through natural selection. Since 1945, about 1,000 species of insects and rodents (mostly rats) and 550 types of weeds and plant diseases have developed genetic resistance to one or more pesticides. Since 1996, the widespread use of glyphosate herbicide has led to at least 15 species of \u201csuperweeds\u201d that are genetically resistant to it.\n\u2022\tThey can put farmers on a financial treadmill. Because of genetic resistance, farmers can find themselves having to pay more and more for a chemical pest control program that can become less and less effective.\n\u2022\tSome insecticides kill natural predators and parasites that help to control the pest populations. About 100 of the 300 most destructive insect pests in the United States were minor pests until widespread use of insecticides wiped out many of their natural predators. (See the Case Study that follows.)\n\u2022\tPesticides are usually applied inefficiently and often pollute the environment. According to the USDA, about 98\u201399.9% of the insecticides and more than 95% of the herbicides applied by aerial spraying or ground spraying do not reach the target pests. They end up in the air, surface water, groundwater, bottom sediments, food, and nontarget organisms, including humans.\n\u2022\tSome pesticides harm wildlife. According to the USDA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, each year, some of the pesticides applied to cropland poison honeybee colonies on which we depend for pollination of many food crops (see Chapter 8, Core Case Study, p. 162, and Science Focus 8.2, p. 172).\n According to a study \nby the Center for Biological Diversity, pesticides menace about a third of all endangered and threatened species in the United States.\n\u2022\tSome pesticides threaten human health. The WHO and UNEP have estimated that pesticides annually poison at least 3 million agricultural workers in less-developed countries and at least 300,000 workers in the United States. They also cause 20,000\u201340,000 deaths per year, worldwide. According to studies by the National Academy of Sciences, pesticide residues in food cause an estimated 4,000\u201320,000 cases of cancer per year in the United States.\nThe pesticide industry disputes these claims, arguing \nthat if used as directed, pesticides do not remain in the \nenvironment at levels high enough to cause serious envi-ronmental or health problems.

When the residents became threatened by sylvatic plague carried by rat fleas, the WHO parachuted healthy cats onto the island to help control the rats. Operation Cat Drop worked.\nBut then the villagers\u2019 roofs began to fall in. The diel-\ndrin had killed wasps and other insects that fed on a type of caterpillar that had either avoided or was not affected by the insecticide. With most of its predators eliminated, the caterpillar population exploded, munching its way through its favorite food: the leaves used in thatch roofs.\nUltimately, this story ended well. Both malaria and the \nunexpected effects of the spraying program were brought under control. Nevertheless, this chain of unintended and unforeseen events reminds us that whenever we inter -\nvene in nature and affect organisms that interact with one another, we need to ask, \u201cNow what will happen?\u201d\nPesticide Use Has Not Consistently \nReduced U.S. Crop Losses to Pests\nLargely because of genetic resistance and the loss of many \nnatural predators, synthetic pesticides have not always succeeded in reducing U.S. crop losses. When David Pi-mentel, an expert on insect ecology, evaluated data from more than 300 agricultural scientists and economists, he reached three major conclusions. First, between 1942 and 1997, estimated crop losses from insects almost doubled from 7% to 13%, despite a 10-fold increase in the use of synthetic insecticides. Second, according to the Interna-tional Food Policy Research Institute, the estimated envi-ronmental, health, and social costs of pesticide use in the United States are $5\u2013$10 in damages for every dollar spent on pesticides. Third, experience indicates that alternative pest management practices could cut the use of synthetic pesticides by half on 40 major U.S. crops without reducing crop yields (Concept 10.4).\nThe pesticide industry disputes these findings. How-\never, numerous studies and experience support them. For example, Sweden has cut its pesticide use in half with al-most no decrease in crop yields. And the soup company Campbell\u2019s\n\u00ae uses no pesticides on the tomatoes it grows in \nMexico, and yields have not dropped.\nLaws and Treaties Can Help to Protect Us \nfrom the Harmful Effects of Pesticides\nMore than 20,000 different pesticide products are used in \nthe United States. Three federal agencies, the EPA, the USDA, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), regulate the use of these pesticides under the Federal In-secticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), first passed in 1947 and amended in 1972.\nUnder FIFRA, the EPA was supposed to assess the \nhealth risks of the active ingredients in synthetic pesticide products already in use. However, since 1972, less than 10% of the active ingredients in pesticide products have been tested for chronic health effects. And serious evalua-tion of the health effects of the 1,200 inactive ingredients is only partially done. The EPA says that the U.S. Congress has not provided them with enough funds to carry out this complex and lengthy evaluation process.\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection \nAct, mostly because of growing scientific evidence and citi-zen pressure concerning the effects of small amounts of pesticides on children. This act requires the EPA to reduce the allowed levels of pesticide residues in food by a factor of 10 when there is inadequate information on the poten-tially harmful effects on children.\nBetween 1972 and 2013, the EPA used FIFRA to ban \nor severely restrict the use of 64 active pesticide ingredi-ents, including DDT and most other", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3741, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b704666-3d52-43a7-a2ed-fe9bd7e000da": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b704666-3d52-43a7-a2ed-fe9bd7e000da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "234", "file_name": "G.

However, according to studies by the National Academy of Sciences, federal laws regulating pesticide use generally are inadequate and poorly en-forced by the three agencies. One study found that as much as 98% of the potential risk of developing cancer from pesticide residues on food grown in the United States would be eliminated if EPA standards were as strict for pesticides developed before 1972 as they are for newer pesticides.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Pesticides and Food Choices\nAccording to the environmental Working Group ( eWG), a research organization \nthat helped to push through the Food Quality Protection Act, you could reduce \nyour pesticide intake by up to 90% by eating only 100% USDA certified Or -\nganic versions of 12 types of fruits and vegetables that tend to have the high-est pesticide residues. \nin 2014, these foods, which the eWG calls the \u201cdirty \ndozen,\u201d were apples, strawberries, grapes, celery, peaches, spinach, sweet bell peppers, imported nectarines, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, imported snap peas, and potatoes.\nIn what environmental scientists call a circle of poison, or \nthe boomerang effect, residues of synthetic pesticides that have \nbeen banned in one country but exported to other countries \ncan return to the exporting countries on imported food. Winds can also carry persistent pesticides from one country to another.\nIn 1998, more than 50 countries developed an interna-\ntional treaty that requires exporting countries to have in-formed consent from importing counties for exports of 22 synthetic pesticides and 5 industrial chemicals. In 2000, more than 100 countries developed an international agreement to ban or phase out the use of 12 especially hazardous persistent organic pollutants (POPs)\u20149 of them persistent hydrocarbon pesticides such as DDT and other chemically similar pesticides. By 2011, the initial list of 12 chemicals had been expanded to 21. In 2004, the POPs treaty went into effect and by 2013, had been signed or ratified by 172 countries, not including the United States.\n90446_ch10_214-247.indd   234 8/13/14   8:42 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Here are some of these alternatives:\n\u2022\tFool the pest. A variety of cultivation practices can be used \nto fake out pests. Examples include rotating the types of crops planted in a field each year and adjusting planting times so that major insect pests either starve or get eaten by their natural predators.\n\u2022\tProvide homes for pest enemies. Farmers can increase the use of polyculture, which uses plant diversity to reduce losses to pests by providing habitats for the predators of pest species.\n\u2022\tImplant genetic resistance. Use genetic engineering to speed up the development of pest- and disease-  \nresistant crop strains. But controversy persists  \nover whether the projected advantages of using  \nGM plants outweigh their projected disadvantages (Figure 10.15).\n\u2022\tBring in natural enemies. Use biological control by importing natural predators (Figures 10.18 and 10.21), parasites, and disease-causing bacteria and viruses to help regulate pest populations. This approach is nontoxic to other species and is usually less costly than applying pesticides. However, some biological control agents are difficult to mass-produce and are often slower acting and more difficult to apply than synthetic pesticides are. Sometimes the agents can multiply and become pests themselves.\n\u2022\tUse insect perfumes. Trace amounts of sex attractants  \n(called pheromones) can be used to lure pests into traps \nor to attract their natural predators into crop fields. Each of these chemicals attracts only one species. They have little chance of causing genetic resistance and are not harmful to nontarget species. However, they are costly and time-consuming to produce.\n\u2022\tBring in the hormones. Hormones are chemicals produced by animals to control their developmental processes at different stages of life. Scientists have learned how to identify and use hormones that disrupt an insect\u2019s normal life cycle, thereby preventing it from reaching maturity and reproducing. Use of insect hormones has some of the same advantages and disadvantages as use of sex attractants has. Also, they take weeks to kill an insect, are often ineffective with large infestations of insects, and sometimes break down before they can act.\n\u2022\tReduce the use of synthetic herbicides to control weeds.  \nOrganic farmers control weeds by methods such as crop rotation, mechanical cultivation, hand weeding, and the use of cover crops and mulches.\nIntegrated Pest Management  \nIs a Component of More  Sustainable Agriculture\nMany pest control experts and farmers believe the best \nway to control crop pests is through integrated pest management (IPM), a carefully designed program in which each crop and its pests are evaluated as parts of an ecosystem, and farmers use a carefully coordinated combi-nation of cultivation, biological, and chemical tools and techniques (Concept 10.4).\nThe overall aim of IPM is to reduce crop damage to an \neconomically tolerable level. Each year, crops are rotated in an effort to disrupt pest infestations. When farmers de-tect an economically damaging level of pests in any field, they first use biological methods (natural predators, para-sites, and disease organisms) and cultivation controls (such as altering planting time and using large machines to vacuum up harmful bugs). They apply small amounts  \nof synthetic insecticides\u2014preferably biopesticides\u2014only when insect or weed populations reach a threshold where the potential cost of pest damage to crops outweighs the cost of applying the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3757, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe770919-d65d-4bc1-9772-7d0abb02ee37": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe770919-d65d-4bc1-9772-7d0abb02ee37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "G.

In Sweden and Denmark, \nfarmers have used it to cut their synthetic pesticide use by more than half. In Cuba, where organic farming is used almost exclusively, farmers make extensive use of IPM. In Brazil, IPM has reduced pesticide use on soybeans by as much as 90%. In Japan, many farmers save money by us-ing ducks for pest control in rice paddies. The ducks\u2019 drop-pings provide nutrients for the rice plants.FIGURE 10.21   Natural capital: In this example of biological pest \ncontrol, a wasp is parasitizing a gypsy moth caterpillar.\nScott Bauer/USDA Agricultural Research Service\n90446_ch10_214-247.indd   235 8/13/14   8:42 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

IPM can also reduce inputs of fertilizer and irrigation water, and slow the development of genetic resis-tance, because pests are attacked less often and with lower doses of pesticides. IPM is an important form of pollution prevention that reduces risks to wildlife and human health, applies the biodiversity principle of sustainability, and expands our beneficial environmental impact.\nDespite its promise, IPM\u2014like any other form of pest \ncontrol\u2014has some drawbacks. It requires expert knowl-edge about each pest situation and takes more time than does using conventional pesticides. Methods developed for a crop in one area might not apply to areas with even slightly different growing conditions. Initial costs may be higher, although long-term costs typically are lower than those of using conventional pesticides. Widespread use of IPM has been hindered in the United States and other countries by government subsidies that support use of synthetic chemical pesticides, as well as by opposition from pesticide manufacturers, and a shortage of IPM ex-perts. \nGREEN CAREER:  Integrated pest management\nA growing number of scientists are urging the USDA to \nuse a three-point strategy to promote IPM in the United States. First, add a small sales tax on synthetic pesticides \nand use the revenue to fund IPM research and education. Second, set up a federally supported IPM demonstration project on at least one farm in every county in the United States. Third, train USDA field personnel and county farm \nagents in IPM so they can help farmers use this alternative. Several UN agencies and the World Bank have joined to-gether to establish an IPM facility. Its goal is to promote the use of IPM by disseminating information and estab-lishing networks among researchers, farmers, and agricultural extension agents involved in IPM.\n10.5 HOW CAN WE IMPROVE  \nFOOD SECURITY?\nCONCEPT 10.5   We can improve food security by reducing \npoverty and chronic malnutrition, producing food more sus-\ntainably, relying more on locally grown food, and cutting food waste.\nUse Government Policies to Improve Food \nProduction and Security\nAgriculture is a financially risky business. Whether farm-\ners have a good or bad year depends on factors over which they have little control, including weather, crop prices, pests and diseases, interest rates on loans, and global food markets.GOOD\nNEWSGovernments use two main approaches to influence \nfood production. First, they can control food prices by put-\nting a legally mandated upper limit on them in order to \nkeep them artificially low. This makes consumers happy but makes it harder for farmers to make a living.\nSecond, they can provide subsidies by giving farmers price \nsupports, tax breaks, and other financial support to help them stay in business and to encourage them to increase food production. However, if government subsidies are too generous and the weather is good, farmers and livestock producers may produce more food than can be sold.\nSome analysts call for ending such subsidies. They point \nto New Zealand, which ended farm subsidies in 1984. After the shock wore off, innovation took over and production of some foods such as milk quadrupled. Brazil has also ended most of its farm subsidies. Some analysts call for replacing traditional subsidies for farmers with subsidies that pro-mote more environmentally sustainable farming practices.\nSimilarly, government subsidies to fishing fleets can \npromote overfishing and the reduction of aquatic biodi-versity.

This would involve simple mea-sures such as immunizing more children against childhood diseases, preventing dehydration due to diarrhea by giving infants a mixture of sugar and salt in their water, and pre-venting blindness by giving children an inexpensive vita-min A capsule twice a year.\nThere are also many private, mostly nonprofit, organi-\nzations that are working to help individuals, communities, and nations to improve their food security and produce food more sustainably. For example, Growing Power\u2019s Will Allen (Core Case Study) argues that instead of trying to transfer complex technologies such as genetic engineering to less-developed countries, we should be helping them to develop simple, sustainable, local food production and distribution systems that will give them more control over their food security.\nSustainable agriculturalists and National Geographic \nEmerging Explorers Cid Simones and Paola Segura work with small farmers to show them how to grow food more sustainably on small plots in the tropical forests of Brazil. They train one family at a time. In return, each family must teach five other families and thus help to spread more sustainable farming methods. Another person who is working toward this goal in Africa is National Geographic Explorer Jennifer Burney (Individuals Matter 10.1).\n90446_ch10_214-247.indd   236 8/13/14   8:42 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

A growing number of consumers are becoming \u201clocavores\u201d and buying more of their food from local and regional producers in farmers\u2019 markets.\nIn addition, many people are participating in community-\nsupported agriculture (CSA) programs in which they buy shares of a local farmer\u2019s crop and receive a box of fruits or vegetables each week during the summer and fall. Growing Power (Core Case Study) runs such a program that serves people now living in a food desert. In some communities, including Raleigh, North Carolina, mobile grocers-on-wheels  \nbusinesses bring fresh and healthy food to people who live in food deserts. By buying locally, people support local economies and farm families. They also help to reduce fos-sil fuel energy costs for food producers, as well as the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from refrigeration and transportation of food products over long distances.\nAn increase in the demand for locally grown food \ncould result in more small, diversified farms that produce organic, minimally processed food from plants and ani-mals. Such eco-farming could be one of this century\u2019s challenging new careers for many young people. \nGREEN \nCAREER:  Small-scale sustainable agricultureAccording to the USDA, around 15% of the world\u2019s \nfood is grown in urban areas, and this percentage could easily be doubled. People are planting gardens and raising chickens in many urban and suburban backyards, growing dwarf fruit trees in large containers of soil, and raising vegetables on rooftops, balconies, and patios. People are also building raised gardening beds in urban parking lots\u2014a growing practice known as asphalt gardening. Food col-umnist Mark Bittman estimated that converting 10% of Americans lawns into food-producing gardens would sup-ply one-third of the country\u2019s fresh produce.\nMany urban schools, colleges, and universities are ben-\nefitting greatly from having gardens on school grounds. Not only do the students have a ready source of fresh produce, but they also learn about where their food comes from and how to grow their own food more sustainably. FoodCorps, a part of the U.S. government AmeriCorps program, is trying to help reduce childhood obesity by promoting nutrition education, farm-to-school food delivery programs, and school gardens.\nIn the future, much of our food might be grown in cit-\nies within specially designed high-rise buildings. Growing Power (Core Case Study) has plans to build such a vertical farm at its Milwaukee site. This five-story, largely glass-enclosed building with crops growing on every floor would put into practice the three scientific princi-ples of sustainability. It would have rooftop solar \nGOOD\nNEWS\nJennifer Burney: Environmental Scientist and National \nGeographic Emerging Explorer\nEnvironmental scientist and National Geographic Emerging Explorer Jennifer Burney notes \nthat subsistence farmers represent the majority of the world\u2019s poorest people and need to boost their productivity for better standards of living and health.

A 2011 UN study found that about 33% of all food produced globally is lost during production or thrown away. According to the EPA and a 2012 study by the Natu-ral Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Americans throw away 30% to 40% of the country\u2019s food supply each year.\n10.6 HOW CAN WE PRODUCE FOOD \nMORE SUSTAINABLY?\nCONCEPT 10.6   We can produce food more sustainably by \nusing resources more efficiently, sharply decreasing the \nharmful environmental effects of industrialized food pro-duction, and eliminating government subsidies that pro-mote such harmful impacts.\nMany Farmers Are Reducing Soil Erosion\nLand used for food production must have fertile topsoil \n(Figure 10.A), which takes hundreds of years to form. Thus, sharply reducing topsoil erosion is the single most important component of more sustainable agriculture and one of the most important ways to increase our beneficial environmental impact.\nSoil conservation involves using a variety of meth-\nods to reduce topsoil erosion and restore soil fertility, mostly by keeping the land covered with vegetation. For example, terracing involves converting steeply sloped land \ninto a series of broad, nearly level terraces that run across the land\u2019s contours (Figure 10.22a). Each terrace retains water for crops and reduces topsoil erosion by controlling runoff.\nOn less steeply sloped land, contour planting (Figure \n10.22b) can be used to reduce topsoil erosion. It involves plowing and planting crops in rows across the slope of the land rather than up and down. Each row acts as a small dam to help hold topsoil by slowing runoff. Similarly, strip-cropping (Figure 10.22b) helps to reduce erosion and to restore soil fertility with alternating strips of a row crop (such as corn or cotton) and another crop that completely covers the soil, called a cover crop (such as alfalfa, clover, oats, or rye). The cover crop traps topsoil that erodes from the row crop and catches and reduces water runoff.\nAlley cropping, or agroforestry (Figure 10.22c), is another \nway to slow the erosion of topsoil and to maintain soil fertility. One or more crops, usually legumes or other crops that add nitrogen to the soil, are planted together in alleys between orchard trees or fruit-bearing shrubs, which pro-vide shade. This reduces water loss by evaporation and helps retain and slowly release soil moisture.Farmers can also establish windbreaks, or shelterbelts, of \ntrees around crop fields to reduce wind erosion (Figure 10.22d). The trees retain soil moisture, supply wood for fuel, and provide habitats for birds and insects that help with pest control and pollination.\nAnother way to greatly reduce topsoil erosion is to \neliminate or minimize the plowing and tilling of topsoil and to leave crop residues on the ground. Such conservation-tillage farming uses special tillers and planting machines that inject seeds and fertilizer directly through crop resi-dues into minimally disturbed topsoil. Weeds are con-trolled with herbicides. This type of farming increases crop yields and greatly reduces soil erosion and water pollution from sediment and fertilizer runoff.\nIn 2011, farmers used conservation tillage on about \n63% of U.S. cropland (up from 17% in 1982).

But the United States is currently the only major food-producing nation to be significantly reducing its topsoil losses.CONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Corn, Ethanol, and Soil Conservation\nin recent years, some U.S. farmers took erodible land out of the conservation \nreserve in order to receive more generous government subsidies for planting \ncorn (which removes nitrogen from the soil and reduces the ability of soil to store carbon by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) to make etha-nol for use as a motor vehicle fuel. This led to mounting political pressure to abandon or sharply cut back on the nation\u2019s highly successful topsoil conserva-tion reserve program.\nWe Can Restore Soil Fertility\nThe best way to maintain soil fertility is through topsoil \nconservation, especially through methods that keep top-soil covered with vegetation (Figure 10.22). The next best option is to restore some of the lost plant nutrients that Farmers can also establish windbreaks, or shelterbelts, of \ntrees around crop fields to reduce wind erosion (Figure 10.22d).

To do this, farmers can use organic fertilizer derived from plant and animal materials or synthetic inorganic fertil-izer made of inorganic compounds that contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with trace amounts of other plant nutrients.\nThere are several types of organic fertilizers. One is ani-\nmal manure: the dung and urine of cattle, horses, poul-try (Figure 10.23), and other farm animals. It improves topsoil structure, adds organic nitrogen, and stimulates the growth of beneficial soil bacteria and fungi. Another type, called green manure, consists of freshly cut or growing green vegetation that is plowed into the topsoil to increase the organic matter and humus available to the next crop. A third type is compost, produced when mi-croorganisms break down organic matter such as leaves, crop residues, food wastes, paper, and wood in the pres-ence of oxygen.\nThe Growing Power farm (Core Case Study) depends \ngreatly on its large piles of compost. Will Allen invites local grocers and restaurant owners to send their food wastes to add to the pile. Also, the process of composting generates a considerable amount of heat, which is used to help warm the farm\u2019s greenhouses during cold months.\nOne way to degrade soils is to plant crops such as corn \nand cotton on the same land several years in a row, a prac-tice that can deplete nutrients\u2014especially nitrogen\u2014in the topsoil. Crop rotation is one way to reduce such losses. A farmer plants an area with a nutrient-depleting crop one year, and the next year, plants the same area with le-gumes, whose root nodules add nitrogen to the soil. This method helps to restore topsoil nutrients while reducing erosion by keeping the topsoil covered with vegetation.\nMany farmers, especially those in more-developed \ncountries, rely on synthetic inorganic fertilizers. The use of these products has grown more than ninefold since 1950, and it now accounts for about 25% of the world\u2019s crop yield. While these fertilizers can replace depleted inorganic nutrients, they do not replace organic matter. Completely restoring topsoil nutrients requires both inorganic and organic fertilizers.\nWe Can Reduce Soil Salinization  \nand Desertification\nWe know how to prevent and deal with soil salinization, \nas summarized in Figure 10.24. The problem is that most of these solutions are costly.\nReducing desertification is not easy. We cannot control \nthe timing and location of prolonged droughts caused by changes in weather and climate patterns. But we can re-duce population growth, overgrazing, deforestation, and \nFIGURE 10.23   Chickens add fertilizer to the soil on this Pennsylvania farm.

We can also work to decrease the human contribution to projected climate change, which could increase the severity of droughts in larger areas of the world during this century.\nIt is possible to restore land suffering from desertifica-\ntion by planting trees and other plants that anchor topsoil and hold water (Figure 10.12). We can also grow trees and crops together (alley cropping, Figure 10.22c), and estab-lish windbreaks around farm fields (Figure 10.22d).\nSome Producers Practice More  \nSustainable Aquaculture\nFigure 10.25 lists some ways to make aquaculture more \nsustainable and to reduce its harmful environmental ef-fects. The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) has developed aquaculture sustainability standards, but it has certified only about 4.6% of the world\u2019s aquaculture pro-duction operations.\nOne approach is open-ocean aquaculture, which involves \nraising large carnivorous fish in underwater pens\u2014some as large as a high school gymnasium. Some are located as far as 300 kilometers (190 miles) offshore (see Figure 9.24, p. 207) where rapid currents can sweep away fish wastes and dilute them.\nOther fish farmers are reducing coastal damage from \naquaculture by raising shrimp and fish species in inland facilities using zero-discharge freshwater ponds and tanks. In such recirculating aquaculture systems, the water used to raise the fish is continually recycled.In the long run, making aquaculture more sustainable \nwill require some fundamental changes for producers and consumers. One change is for more consumers to choose fish species that eat algae and other vegetation rather than other fish. Raising carnivorous fishes such as salmon, trout, tuna, grouper, and cod contributes to overfishing and population crashes within species used to feed these carnivores, and will eventually be unsustainable. Aquacul-ture producers can avoid this problem by raising plant-eating fishes such as carp, tilapia, and catfish, as long as they do not try to increase yields by feeding fishmeal to such species, as many of them are doing.\nOne advocate of sustainable seafood consumption is \nBarton Seaver, a conservationist and National Geographic Fellow. As a chef at several of Washington, D.C.\u2019s, top res-taurants, he brought the concept of sustainable seafood consumption to the nation\u2019s capital. The Seafood Choices Alliance has called him a leader in seafood sustainability.\nFish farmers can also emphasize polyaquaculture, which \nhas been part of aquaculture for centuries, especially in Southeast Asia. Polyaquaculture operations raise fish or shrimp along with algae, seaweeds, and shellfish in coastal lagoons, ponds, and tanks. The wastes of the fish or shrimp feed the other species. Polyaquaculture applies the chemi-cal cycling and biodiversity principles of sustain-ability. \nGREEN CAREER:  Sustainable aquaculture\nWe Can Produce Meat and Dairy Products \nMore Efficiently\nMeat production has a huge environmental impact and \nmeat consumption is the largest factor in the growing eco-logical footprints of individuals in affluent nations.\nA more sustainable form of meat production and con-\nsumption would involve shifting from less grain-efficient forms of animal protein, such as beef, pork, and carnivo-rous fish produced by aquaculture, to more grain-efficient forms, such as poultry and plant-eating farmed fish \nSoil Salinization\nReduce irrigation\nUse more efficient \nirrigation methods\nSwitch to salt- \ntolerant cropsFlush soil (expensive and inefficient)\nStop growing crops \nfor 2\u20135 years\nInstall underground", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3718, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1526730-a1e7-4bb5-8b88-78a4bc596367": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1526730-a1e7-4bb5-8b88-78a4bc596367", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "G.

We could also shift from buying chicken \nthat has been raised in CAFOs (Figure 10.6), which pro-duce large amounts of manure that is not returned to the soil, to supporting free-range chicken operations that use chicken manure to fertilize the soil (Figure 10.23).\nA growing number of people have one or two meatless \ndays per week. Others go further and eliminate most or all meat from their diets, replacing it with a balanced vegetar -\nian diet of fruits, vegetables, and protein-rich foods such as peas, beans, and lentils. According to agricultural science writer Michael Pollan, if all Americans picked one day per week to have no meat, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be equivalent to taking 30 to 40 million cars off the road for a year.\nWe Can Make a Shift to More Sustainable \nFood Production\nModern industrialized food production has yielded huge \namounts of food at affordable prices, but to a growing number of analysts, it is unsustainable, because it violates the three scientific principles of sustainability. It relies heavily on the use of fossil fuels and thus adds greenhouse gases and other air pollutants to the atmo-sphere and contributes to climate change. It also reduces biodiversity and agrobiodiversity and interferes with the cycling of plant nutrients. These harmful effects are hid-den from consumers because most of the harmful envi-ronmental and health costs of food production (Figure 10.8) are not included in the market prices of food\u2014a vio-lation of the full-cost pricing principle of sustainability.\nA more sustainable food production system would \nhave several major components (Figure 10.27) (Concept 10.6). One such component is USDA 100% Certified Or -\nganic Agriculture (Figure 10.3). Many experts support a shift to organic farming because it sharply reduces the harmful environmental and health effects of industrialized farming, improves the condition of topsoil, and reduces pollution of air and water.\nAnother important component of more sustainable \nagriculture would be to rely less on conventional mono-culture and more on organic polyculture. Of particular interest to some scientists is the idea of using polyculture to grow perennial crops\u2014crops that grow back year after year on their own (Science Focus 10.2).\nAnother key to developing more sustainable agricul-\nture is to shift from using fossil fuels to relying more on renewable energy for food production\u2014an important ap-plication of the solar energy principle of sustainability that has been well demonstrated by the Growing Power farm (Core Case Study). To produce the electricity and fuels needed for food production, farmers can make greater use of renewable solar energy (see chapter-opening photo), wind, flowing water, and biofuels produced from farm wastes in tanks called biogas digesters.\nAnalysts suggest five major strategies to help farmers \nand consumers to make the transition to more sustainable agriculture over the next 50 years (Concept 10.6). First, \ngreatly increase research on more sustainable organic farming and perennial polyculture, and on improving hu-man nutrition. Second, establish education and training \nBeef cattle\nPigs\nChicken\nFish (catfish\nor carp)7\n4\n2.2\n2\nFIGURE 10.26   Kilograms of grain required for each kilogram of \nbody weight added for each type of animal.\nCompiled by the authors using data from U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nMore Sustainable Food Production\nSoil erosion\nSoil salinizationWater pollutionAquifer depletionOvergrazingOverfishingLoss of biodiversity \nand agrobiodiversity\nFossil fuel useGreenhouse gas \nemissions\nSubsidies for \nunsustainable farmingHigh-yield polyculture\nOrganic fertilizersBiological pest \ncontrol\nIntegrated pest", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3793, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7abb408c-6f21-424b-80e1-4f2dde2ed477": {"__data__": {"id_": "7abb408c-6f21-424b-80e1-4f2dde2ed477", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "242", "file_name": "G.

Third, set up an international fund to give farmers in poor countries access to various types of more sustainable agriculture. Fourth, replace government subsidies for environmentally harmful forms of industrialized food production with sub-sidies that encourage more sustainable food production. And fifth, mount a massive program to educate consumers \nabout where their food really comes from, how it is pro-duced, and what are the harmful environmental and health effects of industrialized food production.\nFigure 10.28 lists ways in which you can promote more \nsustainable food production. The demand for such produc-tion would likely grow if large numbers of people were to adopt a nutritious diet, such as the one suggested by the Harvard School of Public Health in 2014 (Figure 10.29).\nYou could also grow some of your own food\u2014channel-\ning your inner farmer and getting your hands dirty by raising some organic vegetables in your back yard, in a window box, or in a shared neighborhood garden. You would learn a little about where some of your food comes from, while making a beneficial environmental impact.\nSome scientists call for greater reliance \non polycultures of perennial crops as a \ncomponent of more sustainable agri-culture. Such crops can live for many years without having to be replanted and are better adapted to regional soil and climate conditions than are most annual crops. One scientist who is ex-ploring perennial agriculture is soil \n expert Jerry Glover, a National \n Geographic emerging explorer. He \nstudies perennial farming systems around the world, working for the  \nU.S. Agency for International Development.\nMore than three decades ago, plant \ngeneticist Wes Jackson co-founded the Land Institute in the U.S. state of Kan-sas. One of the institute\u2019s goals has been to grow a diverse mixture (poly\n-\nculture) of edible perennial plants to supplement traditional annual mono-culture crops and to help reduce the latter\u2019s harmful environmental effects.\nPerennial crops, which live for sev-\neral years, help farmers copy nature by better using and conserving natural re-sources\u2014sunlight, soil, and water. Be-cause there is no need to till the soil and replant perennials each year, this approach produces much less topsoil erosion and water pollution. It also re-duces the need for irrigation because the deep roots of such perennials re-tain more water than do the shorter roots of annuals (Figure 10.B). Often, there is a reduced need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and thus little or no pollution from these sources. Pe-rennial crops also remove and store more carbon from the atmosphere, and growing them requires less energy PERENNIAL POLYCULTURE AND THE LAND INSTITUTE\nthan does growing annual crops in \n conventional monocultures.\nCritical Thinking\nWhy do you think large seed companies generally oppose this form of more sustain-able agriculture?ScienceFocus10.2\nFIGURE 10.B   The roots \nof an annual wheat crop \nplant (left) are much shorter than those of big bluestem (right), a tall-grass prairie perennial plant.\nThe Land Institute\nFIGURE 10.28   Individuals matter: Ways to promote more sustain-\nable food production (Concept 10.6).

Its founder Will Allen, in demonstrating  \nhow organic food can be grown more sustainably at afford-able prices, is showing how to make the transition to more sustainable food production while applying the three  \nscientific principles of sustainability.  Modern indust-  \nrialized agriculture, aquaculture, and other forms of industri-alized food production violate all of these principles.\nMaking the transition to more sustainable food produc-\ntion means relying more on solar (see chapter-opening photo) and other forms of renewable energy and less on fossil fuels. It also means sustaining chemical cycling by conserving topsoil and returning crop residues and animal wastes to the soil. It involves helping to sustain natural, agricultural, and aquatic biodiversity by relying on a greater variety of crop and animal strains and seafood, produced by certified organic methods and sold locally in grocery stores and farmers\u2019 markets (see photo at right).\n Controlling pest populations through broader \nuse of conventional and perennial polyculture and integrated pest management will also help to sustain biodiversity.\nGovernments could help these efforts by replacing envi-\nronmentally harmful agricultural and fishing subsidies and tax breaks with more environmentally beneficial ones. Finally, the transition to more sustainable food production would be ac-celerated for the benefit of the environment as well as cur -\nrent and future generations if we could find ways to include the harmful environmental and health costs of food produc-tion in the market prices of food, in keeping with all three so-cial science principles of sustainability.TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nGrowing Power and Sustainability\nBaloncici/Shutterstock.com\u2022 About 1 billion people have health problems \nbecause they do not get enough to eat and 1.6 \nbillion people face health problems from eating too much.\n\u2022\n Modern industrialized agriculture has a greater \nharmful impact on the environment than any \nother human activity.\n\u2022 More sustainable forms of food production \ncould greatly reduce the harmful environmental \nand health impacts of industrialized food production systems.BIG IDEAS\nFIGURE 10.29   Suggestions for healthy eating from the Harvard \nSchool of Public Health.STAY ACTIVE!Use healthy oils (like \nolive and canola oil) for cooking, on salad, \nand at the table.

Write a re-port on your findings. If you were to overhear a group of farmers complaining about how much money they must spend on fertilizers, what suggestions would you give them for saving money? Include your answer to this question, along with your reasoning, in your report.advantages of relying more on organic polyculture and perennial crops. What are five strategies that could help farmers and consumers to shift to more sustainable food production? What are three impor -\ntant ways in which individual consumers can help to promote more sustainable food production?\n 10. What are the three big ideas of this chapter? Explain how making the transition to more sustainable food production such as that promoted by the Growing Power farm (Core Case Study) will involve  \napplying the six principles of sustainability. \nnote: Key terms are in bold type.\nCritical Thinking\n 1. Suppose you got a job with Growing Power, Inc. (Core Case Study) and were given the assignment to \nturn an abandoned suburban shopping center and its large parking lot into an organic farm. Write up a plan for how you would accomplish this.\n 2. Do you think that the advantages of organic agricul-ture outweigh its disadvantages? Explain. Do you eat or grow organic foods? If so, explain your reasoning for making this choice. If not, explain your reasoning for some of the food choices you do make.\n 3. Food producers can now produce more than enough food to feed everyone on the planet a healthy diet. Given this fact, why do you think that nearly a bil-lion people are chronically undernourished or mal-nourished? Assume you are in charge of solving this problem, and write a plan for how you will accom-plish it.\n 4. Explain why you support or oppose greatly increas-ing the use of (a) genetically modified food produc-tion and (b) organic perennial polyculture. 5. What might happen to industrialized food production if oil prices rise sharply? How might this affect your life? How will it affect the lives of any children or grandchildren you might eventually have? List two ways in which you would deal with these changes.\n 6. You are the head of a major agricultural agency in the area where you live. Weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using synthetic pesticides and ex-plain why you would support or oppose the in-creased use of such pesticides as a way to help farmers raise their yields. What are the alternatives?\n 7. If the mosquito population in the area where you live were proven to be carrying malaria or some dan-gerous virus, would you want to spray DDT in your yard, inside your home, or all through the local  \narea to reduce this risk? Explain. What are the alternatives?\n 8. According to physicist Albert Einstein, \u201cNothing will benefit human health and increase the chances of survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.\u201d Explain your interpretation of this statement. Are you willing to eat less meat or no meat? Explain.\nDoing Environmental Science\nFor 1 week, weigh the food that is purchased in your home and the food that is thrown out. Also, keep track  \nof the types of food you eat, using categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy, and even more specific categories if you wish. Record and compare these numbers and other data from day to day. Develop a plan for cutting your household food waste in half. Consider making a similar study for your school cafeteria and reporting the results and your recommendations to school officials.\n90446_ch10_214-247.indd   246 8/13/14   8:42 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Most of its water comes from snowmelt in the Rocky Mountains. During the past 100 years, this once free-flowing river has been tamed by a gigantic plumbing system consisting of 14 major dams and reser -\nvoirs (Figure 11.2), and canals that help control flooding and sup-ply water and electricity to farmers, ranchers, industries, and cities.\nThis system of dams and reservoirs provides water and elec-\ntricity from hydroelectric plants at the major dams for roughly 40 million people in seven states\u2014about one of every eight people in the United States. The river\u2019s water is used to produce about 15% of the nation\u2019s crops and livestock. The system also supplies water to some of the nation\u2019s driest and hottest cities. Take away this tamed river, and Las Vegas, Nevada, and Phoenix, Arizona, would be a mostly uninhabitable desert areas; San Diego and Los Angeles, Califor -\nnia, could not support their present populations; and in California\u2019s Imperial Valley, cactus and mesquite plants would eventually replace vast fields of vegetables.\nSo much water is withdrawn from \nthis river to grow crops and support cities in this dry, desert-like climate that very little of it reaches the sea. To make matters worse, since 1999, the system has experienced severe drought, a prolonged period in which precipitation is at least 70% lower and evaporation is higher than normal. This overuse of the Colorado River illustrates the challenges faced by gov-ernments and people living in arid and semiarid regions with shared river sys-tems, as population growth and eco-nomic growth place increasing demands on limited or decreasing supplies of surface water.\nTo many analysts, emerging short-\nages of water for drinking and irriga-tion in several parts of the world represent one of the major environ-mental challenges that we will face during this century.The Colorado River Story\n250 \nCALIFORNIACOLORADOIDAHO\nNEVADAUTAHWYOMING\nNEW MEXICOARIZONADenverCheyenne\nSalt Lake City\nSanta Fe\nPhoenixLos Angeles\nSan\nDiegoLas Vegas\nBoulder CityBoulder\nGrand Junction\nAlbuquerque\nPalmSprings\nTucsonGlen\nCanyonDam Hoover\nDamHooverDamGrand\nCanyonLakePowell\nLakeMead\nGulf ofCaliforniaAll-AmericanCanalColorado RiverUpper\nBasin\nLower\nBasin\n0 100\n0 160Miles\nKilometersDam \nAqueduct\nor canal\nUpper Basin\nLower Basin\nYumaYumaMexicaliMexicali\nFIGURE 11.1   The Colorado River basin: The area drained by this river \nsystem is more than one-twelfth of the land area of the lower 48 states. \nThis map shows 6 of the river\u2019s 14 dams.\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\nFIGURE 11.2   The Glen Canyon Dam was \nbuilt to create the Lake Powell reservoir on the Colorado River.\nPete Mcbride/National Geographic Stock\n90446_ch11_248-287.indd   250 8/13/14   8:48 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

S30, Supplement 4). Look in the mirror. What you see is about 60% water, most of it inside your cells.\nWater is an amazing chemical with unique properties \nthat help to keep us and other species alive (see Science Focus 3.2, p. 51). You could survive for several weeks without food, but for only a few days without freshwa-ter, or water that contains very low levels of dissolved salts. We have no substitute for this vital form of natural capital (Concept 11.1A).\nIt takes huge amounts of water to supply us with food and \nwith most of the other things that we use to meet our daily needs and wants. Water also plays a key role in determining and moderating the earth\u2019s climates and in removing and diluting some of the pollutants and wastes that we produce.\nAccess to freshwater is a global health issue. The World \nHealth Organization (WHO) estimates that each day an aver -\nage of 4,400 people die from waterborne infectious diseases because they do not have access to safe drinking water.\nAccess to freshwater is also an economic issue because \nwater is vital for producing food and energy and for reduc-ing poverty. Because almost half of the world\u2019s people do not have water piped to their homes, people in many less-developed countries, usually women and children, have to find and carry daily supplies of freshwater from distant sources or wells (see chapter-opening photo). Water is also a national and global security issue because of increasing ten-\nsions within and between some nations over access to limited freshwater resources that they share.\nFinally, water is an environmental issue because exces-\nsive withdrawal of freshwater from rivers and aquifers has resulted in falling water tables, dwindling river flows (Core Case Study), shrinking lakes, and disappearing wetlands. This, in combination with water pollution in many areas of the world, has degraded water quality, reduced fish populations, hastened the extinction of some aquatic spe-cies, and degraded aquatic ecosystem services (see Figures 7.18, p. 147, 7.24, p. 151, and 7.25, p. 152).Most of the Earth\u2019s Freshwater Is Not \nAvailable to Us\nOnly a tiny fraction\u2014about 0.024% of the planet\u2019s enor -\nmous water supply\u2014is readily available to us as liquid \nfreshwater, which is stored in accessible underground de-posits and in lakes, rivers, and streams. The rest is in the salty oceans (about 96.5% of the earth\u2019s volume of liquid water), in frozen polar ice caps and glaciers (1.7%), and in deep underground aquifers (1.7%; see Figure 14, p. S30, Supplement 4).\nFortunately, the world\u2019s freshwater supply is continu-\nally recycled, purified, and distributed in the earth\u2019s hydro-\nlogic cycle (see Figure 3.13, p. 52). This irreplaceable water recycling and purification system works well, unless we alter it, overload it with pollutants, or withdraw freshwa-ter from underground and surface water supplies faster than natural processes replenish it.\nWe can also alter the hydrologic cycle through our in-\nfluence on projected climate change.

Research indicates that atmospheric warming is altering the water cycle by evaporating more water into the atmosphere. As a result, on average, wet places will get wetter with more frequent and heavier flooding, dry places will get drier with more intense drought, and many storms will be more violent.\nOn a global basis, we have plenty of freshwater, but it \nis not distributed evenly (Figure 11.3) (Concept 11.1B). For example, Canada, with only 0.5% of the world\u2019s popu-lation, has 20% of its liquid freshwater, while China, with 19% of the world\u2019s people, has only 6.5% of the supply.\nGroundwater and Surface Water Are \nCritical Resources\nSome precipitation infiltrates the ground and percolates \ndownward through spaces in soil, gravel, and rock until an impenetrable layer of rock or clay stops it. The freshwater in these spaces underground is called groundwater\u2014a key component of the earth\u2019s natural capital.\nThe spaces in soil and rock close to the earth\u2019s surface \nhold little moisture. However, below a certain depth, in the zone of saturation, these spaces are completely filled \nwith freshwater. The top of this groundwater zone is the water table. It falls in dry weather, or when we remove groundwater from this zone faster than nature can replen-ish it, and it rises in wet weather.\nDeeper down are geological layers called aquifers, un-\nderground caverns and porous layers of sand, gravel, or rock through which groundwater flows. Some caverns have rivers of groundwater flowing through them. However, the porous layers of sand, gravel, or rock in most aquifers are like large, elongated sponges through which groundwater seeps\u2014typically moving only a meter or so (about 3 feet) per year and rarely more than 0.3 meter (1 foot) per day. Watertight layers of rock or clay below such aquifers keep the freshwater from escaping deeper into the earth.\n90446_ch11_248-287.indd   251 8/13/14   8:48 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Most aquifers are replenished naturally by precipitation that percolates downward through exposed soil and rock, a process called natural recharge. Others are recharged from the side by lateral recharge from nearby lakes, rivers, and streams.\nMost aquifers recharge extremely slowly, and because \nso much of the earth\u2019s urban area landscapes have been built on or paved over, freshwater can no longer penetrate the ground to recharge aquifers below such areas. In addi-tion, in dry areas of the world, there is little precipitation available to recharge aquifers. Deep aquifers that get very little, if any, recharge are called nonrenewable aquifers. Withdrawing freshwater from these aquifers amounts to mining a nonrenewable resource\u2014an example of the trag-edy of the commons (see Chapter 1, pp. 11\u201312).\nAnother crucial resource is surface water, the fresh-\nwater from rain and melted snow that flows or is stored in lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, streams, rivers, estuaries, and the oceans. Precipitation that does not infiltrate the ground or return to the atmosphere by evaporation is called sur-face runoff. The land from which surface runoff drains into a particular stream, lake, wetland, or other body of water is called its watershed, or drainage basin. For example, the drainage basin for the Colorado River is shown in yellow and green on the map in Figure 11.1 (Core Case Study).\nWe Are Using Increasing Amounts of the \nWorld\u2019s Reliable Runoff\nAccording to hydrologists (scientists who study water and \nits movements above, on, and below the earth\u2019s surface), two-thirds of the annual surface runoff of freshwater into rivers and streams is lost in seasonal floods and is not available for human use. The remaining one-third is reli-able surface runoff, which we can generally count on as a source of freshwater from year to year.\nDuring the last century, the human population tripled, \nglobal water withdrawals increased sevenfold, and per capita withdrawals quadrupled. As a result, we now with-draw about 34% of the world\u2019s reliable runoff. This is a global average. In the arid American Southwest, up to 70% of the reliable runoff is withdrawn for human pur -\nposes, mostly for irrigation (Core Case Study). Some water experts project that because of a combination of popula-tion growth, rising rates of water use per person, longer dry periods in some areas, and failure to reduce unneces-sary water losses, we are likely to be withdrawing up to 90% of the reliable freshwater runoff by 2025.\nWorldwide, we use 70% of the freshwater we with-\ndraw each year from rivers, lakes, and aquifers to irrigate cropland and raise livestock. (In arid regions, on average, 90% of all water withdrawn is used for food production.) Industry uses roughly another 20% of the water with-drawn globally each year, and cities and residences use the remaining 10%. Our water footprint is a rough measure of the volume of freshwater that we use directly and indi-rectly to stay alive and to support our lifestyles. Agricul-ture accounts for 92% of humanity\u2019s water footprint.\nAccording to the American Water Works Association, \neach day, the average American (see Case Study that fol-\nFIGURE 11.3   Some countries have ample freshwater.

This water is used mostly for flushing toilets (27%), washing clothes (22%), taking showers (17%), and running faucets (16%), or is lost through leaking pipes, faucets, and other fixtures (14%).\nWe use many times more freshwater indirectly. This \nwater is called virtual water, the freshwater that is not directly consumed but is used to produce food and other products. It makes up a large part of our water footprints, especially in more-developed countries.

The eastern states usually have ample precipita-tion, whereas many western and southwestern states have little (Figure 11.5).\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the \nmajor uses of groundwater and surface freshwater in the United States are the cooling of electric power plants (41% of total water use), irrigation (37%), public water supplies (13%), industry (5%), and livestock production (4%). In the eastern United States, most water is used for manufac-turing and for cooling power plants. In the arid and semi-arid regions of the western half of the United States (Core Case Study), irrigation counts for as much as 85% of fresh-water use.\nWater tables in many water-short areas, especially in \nthe dry western states, are dropping quickly as farmers and rapidly growing urban areas deplete many aquifers faster than they can be recharged. The USGS and the U.S. De-partment of the Interior projected that areas of at least 36 states are likely to face freshwater shortages by 2025 be-cause of a combination of drought, rising temperatures, population growth, urban sprawl, and increased per capita water use (Figure 11.6). In addition, Columbia University climate researchers led by Richard Seager used well-tested climate models to project that the southwestern United States and parts of northern Mexico are very likely to have long periods of extreme drought throughout most of the rest of this century.\nThe Colorado River system (Figure 11.1) will be di-\nrectly affected by such drought.

By 2059, as much as 45% of the earth\u2019s land surface\u2014about 7 times the area of the United States\u2014could experience extreme drought from a combi-nation of natural drought cycles and projected climate change, according to a study by climate researcher David Rind and his colleagues.\nIn 263 of the world\u2019s water basins, two or more coun-\ntries share the available freshwater supplies. However, countries in only 158 of those basins have water-sharing agreements. This explains why conflicts among nations over shared freshwater resources are likely to happen more as populations grow, as demand for water increases, and as supplies shrink in many parts of the world.\nIn 2012, the United Nations (UN) and the WHO re-\nported that about 780 million people\u2014nearly 2.5 times the U.S. population\u2014did not have regular access to enough clean water for drinking, cooking, and washing, mostly due to poverty (Concept 11.1B). The report also noted that more than 2 billion people had gained access to clean water between 1990 and 2012. However, many analysts view the likelihood of expanding water shortages in many parts of the world as one of the most serious environmen-tal, health, and economic problems.\n11.2 HOW CAN WE INCREASE \nFRESHWATER SUPPLIES?\nCONCEPT 11.2A   Groundwater used to supply cities and \ngrow food is being pumped from aquifers in some areas \nfaster than it is renewed by precipitation.\nCONCEPT 11.2B   Large dam-and-reservoir systems and \nwater transfer projects have greatly expanded water sup-plies in some areas, but have also disrupted ecosystems and displaced people.\nCONCEPT 11.2C   We can convert salty ocean water to \nfreshwater, but the cost is high, and the resulting salty brine must be disposed of without harming aquatic or ter -\nrestrial ecosystems.\nGroundwater Is Being Withdrawn Faster \nThan It Is Replenished in Some Areas\nAquifers provide drinking water for nearly half of the \nworld\u2019s people. In the United States, aquifers supply al-most all of the drinking water in rural areas, 20% of that in urban areas, and 37% of the country\u2019s irrigation water. Most aquifers are renewable resources unless the ground-water they contain becomes contaminated or is removed faster than it is replenished. Relying more on groundwater has advantages and disadvantages (Figure 11.8).\nTest wells and other data indicate that water tables are \nfalling in many areas of the world because the rate at which most of the world\u2019s aquifers are being pumped (mostly to irrigate crops) is greater than the rate of natural recharge from rainfall and snowmelt (Concept 11.2A). The world\u2019s three largest grain producers\u2014China, the United States, and India\u2014as well as Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Israel, Libya, Egypt, Pakistan, South Korea, and Spain are overpumping many of their aquifers. According to the World Bank, in 2012, more than 400 mil-lion people (including 190 million in India and 130 million in China) were consuming grain produced through this unsustainable use of groundwater. This number is ex-pected to grow.\nSuch overpumping can lead to shortages of groundwa-\nter needed for irrigation, followed by sharp drops in food production, rising food prices, hunger, and social unrest.

Figure 11.10 shows the areas of greatest aquifer depletion. One of the most serious overdrafts of groundwater is in the lower half of the Ogallala Aquifer, the world\u2019s largest known aquifer, which lies under eight Midwestern states from southern South Dakota to Texas (blowup section of Figure 11.10).\nThe Ogallala Aquifer supplies about one-third of all the \ngroundwater used in the United States and has helped to turn the Great Plains into one of world\u2019s most productive irrigated agricultural regions. The problem is that the Ogallala is essentially a one-time deposit of liquid natural capital with a very slow rate of recharge.\nIn parts of the southern half of the Ogallala, ground-\nwater is being pumped out 10\u201340 times faster than the slow natural recharge rate. This has lowered water tables and raised pumping costs, especially in northern Texas. Such overpumping of aquifers, along with reduced access to Colorado River water (Core Case Study) and population growth, have led to the shrinkage of irrigated croplands in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and California, as well as in-creasing competition for water among farmers, ranchers, and growing urban areas.\nGovernment subsidies\u2014payments or tax breaks de-\nsigned to increase crop production\u2014have encouraged farmers to grow water-thirsty crops in dry areas, which has accelerated depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer. In par -\nticular, corn\u2014a very thirsty crop\u2014has been planted widely on fields watered by the Ogallala. Serious aquifer deple-tion is also taking place in California\u2019s semiarid Central Valley, which supplies half of the country\u2019s fruits and veg-etables (the long red area in the California portion of Fig-ure 11.10).\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Aquifer Depletion in California and \nMeat Consumption in China\nCalifornia\u2019s Central Valley produces huge amounts of alfalfa, which is used as \na supplemental feed for cattle and dairy cows. Alfalfa requires more water than any other crop in California, but very little of this alfalfa is used to feed cattle or dairy cows in California, because alfalfa growers make more money by ship-ping most of it to China. As a result, every year, alfalfa growers export billions of gallons of virtual water from a drought-ridden area of California to China to support its growing consumption of meat and milk.\nFIGURE 11.9   Natural capital degradation: Satellite photos of farmland irrigated by groundwater \npumped from a deep aquifer in a vast desert region of Saudi Arabia between 1986 (left) and 2004 \n(right).

As water tables drop, the energy and financial costs of pumping the water from lower depths rise sharply as farmers must drill deeper wells, buy larger pumps, and use more electricity to run those pumps. Poor farmers cannot afford to do this and often end up losing their land and working for richer farmers or migrating to cities that are already crowded with poor people struggling to survive.\nWithdrawing large amounts of groundwater some-\ntimes causes the sand and rock that is held in place by water pressure in aquifers to collapse. This can cause the land above the aquifer to subside or sink, a phenomenon known as land subsidence. Extreme, sudden subsidence, sometimes referred to as a sinkhole, can swallow cars and houses. Once an aquifer becomes compressed by subsid-ence, recharge is impossible. In addition, land subsidence can damage roadways, water and sewer lines, and build-ing foundations.\nGroundwater overdrafts in coastal areas, where many \nof the world\u2019s largest cities and industrial areas are found, can pull saltwater into freshwater aquifers. The resulting contaminated groundwater is undrinkable and unusable for irrigation. This problem is especially serious in coastal areas of the U.S. states of California, Texas, Florida, Geor -\ngia, South Carolina, and New Jersey, as well as in coastal areas of Turkey, Thailand, and the Philippines.Figure 11.11 lists ways to prevent or slow the problem \nof aquifer depletion by using this largely renewable re-source more sustainably.

The main goals of a dam-and-reservoir system are to capture and store the surface runoff from a river\u2019s watershed, and release it as needed to control floods, to generate electricity (hydro-power), and to supply freshwater for irrigation and for towns and cities. Reservoirs also provide recreational ac-tivities such as swimming, fishing, and boating. Large dams and reservoirs provide benefits but have drawbacks (Figure 11.12).\nThe world\u2019s 45,000 large dams capture and store about \n14% of the world\u2019s surface runoff, provide water for al-most half of all irrigated cropland, and supply more than half the electricity used in 65 countries. By using dams, we have increased the annual reliable runoff available for our uses by nearly 33%. On the down side, this engineering approach to river management has displaced 40\u201380 mil-lion people from their homes, flooded a large area of mostly productive land to establish reservoirs, and im-paired some of the important ecosystem services that riv-ers provide (see Figure 7.25, left, p. 152)(Concept 11.2B)\nA 2007 study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) esti-\nmated that about one out of five of the world\u2019s freshwater fish and plant species are either extinct or endangered, pri-marily because dams and water withdrawals have sharply decreased the flows of many rivers such as the Colorado (Core Case Study).

The study also found that, \n because of dams, excessive water withdrawals, and, in some \nareas, prolonged severe drought, only 21 of the planet\u2019s  \n177 longest rivers consistently run all the way to the sea before running dry (see Case Study that follows).\nWithin 50 years, the reservoirs behind dams typically \nfill up with sediments such as mud and silt, which makes them useless for storing water or producing electricity. For example, in the Colorado River system (Core Case Study), the equivalent of roughly 20,000 dump-truck loads of silt are deposited on the bottoms of the Lake Powell and Lake Mead reservoirs every day. Sometime during this century, these two reservoirs will probably be too full of silt to func-tion as designed. About 85% of all U.S. dam-and-reservoir systems will be 50 years old or more by 2025, and some of those aging dams are being removed because their reser -\nvoirs have filled with silt.\nIf climate change occurs as projected during this cen-\ntury, it will intensify shortages of water in many parts of the world. For example, mountain snows that feed the Colorado River system (Core Case Study) will melt faster and earlier, making less freshwater available to the river system when it is needed for irrigation during hot and dry summer months.\nAlso, as the river\u2019s flow has slowed, the water level in \nLake Mead has dropped below the intake pipes that are a key part of hydroelectric production. This has forced the city of Las Vegas to spend more than $800 million building lower intake pipes to keep the water flowing from Lake Mead through the Hoover Dam.\nIf some of the Colorado\u2019s largest reservoirs drop dra-\nmatically or become filled with silt during this century, the region could experience economic and ecological disrup-tions with political and legal battles over who will get how much of the region\u2019s greatly diminished freshwater supply. Agricultural production would drop sharply and the re-gion\u2019s major desert cities such as Las Vegas, Nevada (which depends on the Colorado for more than 90% of its fresh-water needs), and Phoenix, Arizona, would be challenged to survive. A 2012 report from the U.S. Bureau of Recla-mation concluded that over the next 50 years, the Colo-rado River will not be able to meet the projected water demands of Arizona, New Mexico, and California.\nNearly 3 billion people in South America, China, In-\ndia, and other parts of Asia depend on river flows fed by mountain glaciers, which act like aquatic savings ac-counts. They store precipitation as ice and snow in wet periods and release it slowly during dry seasons for use on farms and in cities. In 2010, according to the World Glacier Monitoring Service, many of these mountain gla-ciers had been shrinking for 19 consecutive years, mostly due to a warming atmosphere. For a while, their melting will increase water supplies. However, if these glaciers eventually disappear, most of those 3 billion people will likely be short of water for all purposes, including food production.CONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Drought, Human Activities,  \nand Water Supplies\nSevere drought and land use activities such as all-terrain vehicle use in desert \nareas can expose soil to erosion by wind, which adds dust to the atmosphere. Strong winds can carry this dust to mountain ranges where it lands on moun-tain snowpacks. The dust-darkened snow melts faster because it absorbs more solar energy than white snow absorbs. These snowpacks then melt earlier and faster, and water supplies for farmers and urban areas are increasingly strained during the warmer summer months.\nCASE STUDY\nHow Dams Can Kill an Estuary\nSince 1905, the amount of water flowing to the mouth of \nthe Colorado River (Core Case Study) has", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3782, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75460957-d15f-4533-a725-804475d2f38c": {"__data__": {"id_": "75460957-d15f-4533-a725-804475d2f38c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "259", "file_name": "G.

In most years since 1960, the river has dwindled to a small, sluggish stream by the time it reaches the Gulf of California.\nThis is the subject of an online short film by National \nGeographic Explorer Alexandra Cousteau (see Individuals Matter 7.1, p. 156), called Death of a River: The Colorado River Delta. In that film, Cousteau explains that the river once emptied into a vast delta, the wetland area at the mouth of a river containing the river\u2019s estuary. It hosted forests, la-goons, and marshes rich in plant and animal life and sup-ported a thriving coastal fishery for hundreds of years.\nSince the damming of the Colorado\u2014within one hu-\nman lifetime\u2014this biologically diverse delta ecosystem has collapsed and is now covered by mud flats and desert. The dams upstream have cut off the water supply that kept the system alive. The delta and its wildlife are now mostly gone and its coastal fishery that fed many generations of area residents is disappearing.\nHistorically, about 80% of the water withdrawn from \nthe Colorado has been used to irrigate crops and raise cattle with the help of government subsidies. Such subsi-dies have led to inefficient use of irrigation water for grow-ing thirsty crops such as rice, cotton, and alfalfa. Also, much of the water in the Colorado\u2019s reservoirs is lost through evaporation and seepage of water into porous rock beds under the reservoirs.\nAccording to Cousteau, if just 1% of the river\u2019s flow \nwere restored to the delta area, much of it could be par -\ntially restored. In 2014, the floodgates of the Morelos Dam near Yuma, Arizona were opened for 2 months to send Colorado River water through the delta to the Gulf of Cali-fornia for the first time in years. Researchers will evaluate the effects of this experiment on the vegetation and soils in the delta.\nTo deal with the root of this problem, water experts call \nfor the seven states using the Colorado River to enact and enforce strict water conservation measures, including clean-ing up and recycling sewage water, as is being done in some urban areas in Southern California.

For example, when you have lettuce in a salad in the United States, chances are good that it was grown in the arid Central Valley of California, partly with the use of irrigation water from the mountains of northeastern California. The California State Water Project (see map in Figure 11.13) is one of the world\u2019s largest freshwater transfer projects. It uses a maze of giant dams, pumps, and lined canals, or aqueducts (photo in \n Figure 11.13), to transport freshwater to the vast farms and heavily populated cities of central and southern California.\nThis massive water transfer has yielded many benefits. \nCalifornia\u2019s heavily irrigated Central Valley supplies half of the United States\u2019 fruits and vegetables, and the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles have grown and flourished because of this water transfer. However, the project has also reduced the flow of the Sacramento River, threaten-ing fisheries and reducing the flushing action that helps to cleanse San Francisco Bay of pollutants. The bay has suf-fered from pollution, and the flow of freshwater to its coastal marshes and other ecosystems has dropped, put-ting stress on wildlife species that depend on these ecosys-tems (Concept 11.2B).\nWater transfers like the California Project are typically \nsubsidized by governments, which has led to inefficient FIGURE 11.13   The California \nState Water Project transfers huge \nvolumes of freshwater from one watershed to another.

In central Califor -\nnia, agriculture consumes three-fourths of the water that is transferred, and much of it is lost through inefficient irrigation systems. Studies have shown that making irriga-tion just 10% more efficient would provide all the water necessary for domestic and industrial uses in southern California. Yet, the inefficient use of water continues be-cause taxpayer subsidies have reduced the price of water to the point where farmers and urban residents have little incentive to invest in more efficient irrigation and water-saving toilets, showerheads, and other water-saving de-vices. Many hydrologists and economists call for replacing these subsidies with subsidies that would encourage more efficient use of water.\nAccording to several studies, projected climate change \nwill make matters worse by sharply reducing surface water availability in California. In northern California, many people depend on snowpacks, bodies of densely packed, slowly melting snow in the High Sierra Mountains, for more than 60% of their freshwater during the hot, dry summer months. Projected atmospheric warming could shrink the snowpacks by as much as 40% by 2050 and by as much as 90% by the end of this century. This will sharply reduce the amount of freshwater available for northern residents and ecosystems, as well as for transfer to arid and semiarid central and southern California.There are many other examples around the world of \nwater transfers that have resulted in environmental degra-dation (see the following Case Study).\nCASE STUDY\nThe Aral Sea Disaster: A Glaring Example \nof Unintended Consequences\nThe shrinking of the Aral Sea (Figure 11.14) is the result \nof a large-scale freshwater transfer project in an area of the former Soviet Union with the driest climate in central Asia. Since 1960, enormous amounts of irrigation water have been diverted from the two rivers that supply water to the Aral Sea. The goal was to create one of the world\u2019s largest irrigated areas, mostly for raising cotton and rice. The irrigation canal, the world\u2019s longest, stretches more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles)\u2014roughly the distance between the two U.S. cities of Boston, Massachusetts, and Chicago, Illinois.\nThis project, coupled with drought and high evapora-\ntion rates due to the area\u2019s hot and dry climate, has caused a regional ecological and economic disaster. Since 1961, the sea\u2019s salinity has risen sevenfold and the average level of its water has dropped by an amount roughly equal to the height of a six-story building. The Southern Aral Sea has lost 90% of its volume of water and most of its lake \n2012 1976\nFIGURE 11.14   Natural capital degradation: The Aral Sea, straddling the borders of Kazakhstan and \nUzbekistan, was one of the world\u2019s largest saline lakes.

Water withdrawal for agriculture has reduced the two rivers feeding the sea to mere trickles.\nAbout 85% of the area\u2019s wetlands have been elimi-\nnated and about half the local bird and mammal species have disappeared. The sea\u2019s greatly increased salt concen-tration\u20143 times saltier than ocean water\u2014has caused the presumed local extinction of 26 of the area\u2019s 32 native fish species. This has devastated the area\u2019s fishing industry, which once provided work for more than 60,000 people. Fishing villages and boats once located on the sea\u2019s coast-line now sit abandoned in a salty desert.\nWinds pick up the sand and salty dust and blow it onto \nfields as far as 500 kilometers (310 miles) away. As the salt spreads, it pollutes water and kills wildlife, crops, and other vegetation. Aral Sea dust settling on glaciers in the Himalayas is causing them to melt at a faster-than-normal rate.\nThe shrinkage of the Aral Sea has also altered the ar -\nea\u2019s climate. The shrunken sea no longer acts as a thermal buffer to moderate the heat of summer and the extreme cold of winter. Now there is less rain, summers are hotter and drier, winters are colder, and the growing season is shorter. The combination of such climate change and se-vere salinization has reduced crop yields by 20\u201350% on almost one-third of the area\u2019s cropland\u2014the opposite of the project\u2019s intended consequences.\nSince 1999, the UN, the World Bank, and the five \ncountries surrounding the lake have worked to improve irrigation efficiency. They have also partially replaced thirsty crops with other crops that require less irrigation water. Because of a dike built to block the flow of water from the Northern Aral Sea into the southern sea, the level of the northern sea has risen by 2 meters (7 feet), its salinity has dropped, dissolved oxygen levels are up, and it supports a healthy fishery.\nHowever, the formerly much larger southern sea is still \nshrinking. By 2012, its eastern lobe was essentially gone (Figure 11.14, right photo), and the European Space Agency projects that the rest of the Southern Aral Sea could dry up completely by 2020.\nRemoving Salt from Seawater Is Costly and \nHas Harmful Effects\nDesalination is the process of removing dissolved salts \nfrom ocean water or from brackish (slightly salty) water in aquifers or lakes. It is another way to increase supplies of freshwater (Concept 11.2C).\nThe two most widely used methods for desalinating \nwater are distillation and reverse osmosis. Distillation in-volves heating saltwater until it evaporates (leaving be-hind salts in solid form) and condenses as freshwater. Reverse osmosis (or microfiltration) uses high pressure to force saltwater through a membrane filter with pores small enough to remove the salt and other impurities. De-salination supplies less than 0.3% of the world\u2019s demand and only about 0.4% of the U.S. demand for freshwater.\nThere are three major problems with the widespread \nuse of desalination. First is the high cost, because it takes a lot of increasingly expensive energy to remove salt from seawater. A second problem is that pumping large volumes of seawater through pipes requires the use of chemicals to sterilize the water and to keep down algae growth, and this kills many marine organisms and also requires large inputs of energy and money. Third, desalination produces huge quantities of salty wastewater that must go some-where.

Because of this failure to apply the full-cost pricing principle of sustainability, users have little or no financial incentive to invest in water-saving technologies.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Government Freshwater Subsidies\nMany argue that government freshwater subsidies promote the farming of un-\nproductive land, stimulate local economies, and help to keep food and electric-ity prices low. Do you think this is reason enough for governments to continue providing subsidies to farmers and cities to help keep the price of freshwater low? Explain.\nHigher prices for freshwater encourage water conser -\nvation but make it difficult for low-income farmers and \ncity dwellers to buy enough water to meet their needs. When South Africa raised water prices, it dealt with this problem by establishing lifeline rates, which give each household a set amount of free or low-priced water to meet basic needs. When users exceed this amount, they pay increasingly higher prices as their water use increases. This is a user-pays approach.The second major cause of unnecessary losses of fresh-\nwater is a lack of government subsidies for improving the effi-ciency of water use. Withdrawing some of the subsidies that encourage inefficient water use and replacing them with subsidies for more efficient water use would sharply re-duce water losses. Understandably, farmers and industries that receive subsidies that keep water prices low have vigorously opposed efforts to eliminate or reduce them.\nWe Can Improve Efficiency in Irrigation\nOnly about 60% of the world\u2019s irrigation water reaches crops, which means that most irrigation systems are highly inefficient. The most inefficient irrigation system, com-monly used in less-developed countries, is flood irrigation, in which water is pumped from a groundwater or surface water source through unlined ditches where it flows by gravity to the crops being watered (Figure 11.15, left). This method delivers far more water than is needed for crop growth and typically, about 45% of this water is lost through evaporation, seepage, and runoff. With existing irrigation technologies (see Figure 11.15, middle and right), this loss could be reduced to 5\u201310%.small enough to remove the salt and other impurities. De-salination supplies less than 0.3% of the world\u2019s demand and only about 0.4% of the U.S. demand for freshwater.\nThere are three major problems with the widespread \nuse of desalination. First is the high cost, because it takes a lot of increasingly expensive energy to remove salt from seawater. A second problem is that pumping large volumes of seawater through pipes requires the use of chemicals to sterilize the water and to keep down algae growth, and this kills many marine organisms and also requires large inputs of energy and money.

Even so, drip irrigation is used on less than 4% of the irrigated crop fields in the world and in the United States, largely because most drip irrigation systems are costly. This percentage rises to 13% in the U.S. state of California, 66% in Israel, and 90% in Cyprus. If freshwater were priced closer to the value of the ecosys-tem services it provides and if government subsidies for inefficient use of water were reduced or eliminated, drip irrigation could more easily be used to irrigate most of the world\u2019s crops.\nAccording to the UN, reducing the current global with-\ndrawal of water for irrigation by just 10% would save enough water to grow crops and meet the estimated ad-ditional water demands of the earth\u2019s cities and in-dustries through 2025. Figure 11.16 summarizes several ways to reduce water losses in crop irrigation. Since 1950, Israel has used many of these techniques to slash irrigation water losses by 84% while irrigating 44% more land. Israel now treats and reuses 30% of its munici-pal sewage water for crop production and plans to increase this to 80% by 2025. The government also gradually elimi-nated most water subsidies to raise Israel\u2019s price of irriga-tion water, which is now one of the highest in the world.\nWe Can Cut Freshwater Losses in Industries \nand Homes\nProducers of chemicals, paper, oil, coal, primary metals, \nand processed foods consume almost 90% of the freshwa-ter used by industries in the United States. Some of these GOOD\nNEWSindustries recapture, purify, and recycle water to reduce \ntheir water use and water treatment costs. For example, more than 95% of the water used to make steel can be recycled. Even so, most industrial processes could be rede-signed to use much less water. \nGREEN CAREER:  Water con-\nservation specialist\nFlushing toilets with freshwater (most of it clean \nenough to drink) is the single largest use of domestic fresh-water in the United States and accounts for about one-fourth of home water use. Since 1992, U.S. government standards have required that new toilets use no more than 6.1 liters (1.6 gallons) of water per flush. Even at this rate, just two flushes of such a toilet require more than the daily amount of water available for all uses to many of the world\u2019s poor people living in arid regions (see chapter-opening photo).\nOther water-saving appliances are widely available. \nLow-flow showerheads can save large amounts of water by cutting the flow of a shower in half. Front-loading clothes washers use 30% less water than top-loading machines use. According to the American Water Works Association, if the typical American household were to stop all water leaks and use these devices, along with low-flow toilets and faucets, it could cut its daily water use by nearly a third.\nAccording to UN studies, 30\u201360% of the water supplied \nin nearly all of the world\u2019s major cities in less-developed countries is lost, primarily through leakage from water mains, pipes, pumps, and valves. Water experts say that fixing these leaks should be a high priority for water-short countries, because it would increase water supplies and cost less than building dams or importing water. Even in advanced industrialized countries such as the United States, these losses to leakage average 10\u201330%. However, leakage losses have been reduced to about 3% in Copenhagen, Denmark, and to 5% in Fukuoka, Japan.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Water Leaks and Water Bills\nAny water", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3701, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5075b264-c283-487f-895c-d013800a3ab4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5075b264-c283-487f-895c-d013800a3ab4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "G.

For example, more than 95% of the water used to make steel can be recycled. Even so, most industrial processes could be rede-signed to use much less water. \nGREEN CAREER:  Water con-\nservation specialist\nFlushing toilets with freshwater (most of it clean \nenough to drink) is the single largest use of domestic fresh-water in the United States and accounts for about one-fourth of home water use. Since 1992, U.S. government standards have required that new toilets use no more than 6.1 liters (1.6 gallons) of water per flush. Even at this rate, just two flushes of such a toilet require more than the daily amount of water available for all uses to many of the world\u2019s poor people living in arid regions (see chapter-opening photo).\nOther water-saving appliances are widely available. \nLow-flow showerheads can save large amounts of water by cutting the flow of a shower in half. Front-loading clothes washers use 30% less water than top-loading machines use. According to the American Water Works Association, if the typical American household were to stop all water leaks and use these devices, along with low-flow toilets and faucets, it could cut its daily water use by nearly a third.\nAccording to UN studies, 30\u201360% of the water supplied \nin nearly all of the world\u2019s major cities in less-developed countries is lost, primarily through leakage from water mains, pipes, pumps, and valves. Water experts say that fixing these leaks should be a high priority for water-short countries, because it would increase water supplies and cost less than building dams or importing water. Even in advanced industrialized countries such as the United States, these losses to leakage average 10\u201330%. However, leakage losses have been reduced to about 3% in Copenhagen, Denmark, and to 5% in Fukuoka, Japan.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Water Leaks and Water Bills\nAny water leak wastes freshwater and raises water bills.

About one-fifth of \nall U.S. public water systems do not use water meters and charge a single low annual rate for almost unlimited use of high-quality freshwater.\nWhen the U.S. city of Boulder, Colorado, introduced \nwater meters, water use per person dropped by 40%. In some cities in Brazil, people buy smart cards, each of which contains a certain number of water credits that entitle their owners to measured amounts of freshwater. Brazil-ian officials say this approach saves water and typically reduces household water bills by 40%. Figure 11.18 lists various ways to use water more efficiently in industries, homes, and businesses (Concept 11.3).\nWe can also collect and store rainwater for future use. \nFor example, Los Angeles, California, plans to build large ponds to capture and store the water that falls on its streets and roofs during winter storms. The plan is to pass the captured rainwater through newly constructed wetlands for transfer into drinking water aquifers. This would sup-ply more drinking water and reduce flooding from storms.\nWe Can Use Less Water to Remove Wastes\nCurrently, we use large amounts of freshwater clean enough to drink to flush away industrial, animal, and household wastes. According to the UN Food and Agricul-ture Organization (FAO), if current growth trends in pop-ulation and water use continue, within 40 years, we will need the world\u2019s entire reliable flow of river water just to dilute and transport the wastes we produce each year.\nWe could save much of this freshwater by recycling \nand reusing gray water from homes and businesses and wastewater from sewage treatment plants for purposes such as cleaning equipment and watering lawns and some crops. Israel reuses 70% of its wastewater to irrigate non-food crops. In Singapore, all sewage water is treated at reclamation plants for reuse by industry. U.S. cities such as Las Vegas, Nevada, and Los Angeles, California, are also beginning to clean up and reuse some of their wastewater. \nForested HillsideEvapotranspiration\nTrees reduce soil\nerosion from heavy\nrain and wind\nTree roots stabilize soil\nVegetation releases waterslowly and reduces /f_looding\nAfter DeforestationAgricultural landis /f_looded andsilted upWinds remove\nfragile topsoilOvergrazing accelerates soilerosion by water and windEvapotranspiration decreasesRoadsdestabilizehillsidesTree plantation\nGullies andlandslides\nHeavy rain erodes topsoil\nSilt from erosion /f_ills rivers and reservoirs Rapid runoff\ncauses /f_loodingAgriculturallandDiverseecologicalhabitat\nANIMATED FIGURE 11.19   Natural capital degradation: A hillside before and after deforestation. \nQuestion: how might a drought in this area make these conditions even worse?\n\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\nReducing Water Losses\n/uni25A0 Redesign manufacturing processes to use less water\n/uni25A0 Recycle water in industry\n/uni25A0 Fix water leaks\n \n/uni25A0 Landscape yards with plants that require little water\n/uni25A0 Use drip irrigation on gardens and lawns\n/uni25A0 Use water-saving showerheads, faucets, appliances, and toilets  \n (or waterless composting toilets)\n/uni25A0 Collect and reuse gray water in and around houses,   \n apartments, and office buildings\n/uni25A0 Raise water prices and use meters, especially in dry urban areasSolutions\nFIGURE 11.18   Ways to reduce freshwater losses in industries, \nhomes, and businesses (Concept 11.3).

Sharply raising this percentage would be a way to apply the chemical cycling principle of sustainability.\nWe Can Reduce the Pollution of \nFreshwater Supplies Due to Flooding\nSome areas have too little freshwater, but others some-\ntimes have too much because of natural flooding by streams, caused mostly by heavy rain or rapidly melting snow. We could use water more sustainably by reducing the human contribution to flooding and the resulting pol-lution of water sources.\nHuman activities have contributed to flooding and wa-\nter pollution in several ways. First, in efforts to reduce the threat of flooding on floodplains, or land areas adjacent to streams and rivers, some rivers have been narrowed and straightened (or channelized), surrounded by protective dikes and levees (long mounds of earth along their banks), and dammed to create reservoirs that store and release water as needed (Figure 11.2). However, in the long run, such measures can lead to greatly increased flooding and surface water pollution when heavy snowmelt or pro-longed rains overwhelm them.\nSecond, in developing land, we have removed a great \ndeal of water-absorbing vegetation, especially on hillsides (Fig-ure 11.19). Once the trees on a hillside have been cut for timber, fuelwood, livestock grazing, or farming, water from precipitation rushes down the denuded slopes, erodes precious topsoil, and can increase flooding and pollution in local streams.\nThe third human activity that increases the severity of \nflooding is the draining of wetlands that naturally absorb floodwaters. These areas are then often covered with pave-ment and buildings that greatly increase runoff, which contributes to flooding and pollution of surface waters.\nMany scientists argue that we could reduce our contri-\nbution to such flooding and water pollution by", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3491, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1f4f500-6777-4eea-99f2-4121c824fec8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1f4f500-6777-4eea-99f2-4121c824fec8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "267", "file_name": "G.

It can come from single (point) sources or from larger and dis-persed (nonpoint) sources. Point sources discharge pol-lutants into bodies of surface water at specific locations through drain pipes (Figure 11.22), ditches, or sewer lines. Examples include factories, sewage treatment plants (which remove some, but not all, pollutants), under -\nground mines, oil wells, and oil tankers.\nBecause point sources are located in specific places, \nthey are fairly easy to identify, monitor, and regulate. Most of the world\u2019s more-developed countries have laws that help control point-source discharges of harmful chemicals \nFIGURE 11.22   Point source of water pollution from an industrial \nplant.\nvasakkohaline/Shutterstock.com\nSandra Postel: National Geographic Fellow  \nand Freshwater Conservationist\nSandra Postel is regarded as one of the world\u2019s most respected authorities on water issues. \nIn 1994 she founded the Global Water Policy Project, which, through research and educa-tion, promotes a deeper knowledge of, and more sustainable use of, the earth\u2019s finite fresh-water supply. Postel has authored or coauthored several influential books and written scores of articles for popular and scholarly publications about using water more sustainably.\nIn her quest to educate people about water supply issues, Postel has appeared on several \ntelevision news shows, taken part in numerous environmental documentary films (including the BBC\u2019s \nPlanet Earth ), and addressed the European Parliament. In 2010, she was ap-\npointed Freshwater Fellow of the National Geographic Society, where she serves as the lead water expert for the society\u2019s freshwater efforts and co-director of \nChange the Course , a na-\ntional freshwater conservation and restoration campaign being piloted in the Colorado River Basin.

In most of the less-\ndeveloped countries, there is little control of such discharges.\nNonpoint sources are broad and diffuse \nareas where rainfall or snowmelt washes pol-lutants off the land into bodies of surface wa-ter. Examples include runoff of eroded soil and chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides from cropland, feedlots, logged forests, urban streets, parking lots, lawns, and golf courses. We have made little progress in controlling water pollution from nonpoint sources be-cause of the difficulty and expense of identify-ing and controlling discharges from so many diffuse sources. According to the U.S. Envi-ronmental Protection Agency (EPA), nonpoint source pollution is the main reason why 40% of all U.S. rivers, lakes, and estuaries are still not clean enough for uses such as fishing and swimming, despite the enactment of major water pollution control laws 40 years ago.\nAgricultural activities are by far the leading \ncause of water pollution. Sediment eroded from agricultural lands (see Figure 10.9,  \np. 224) is the most common pollutant. Other major agricultural pollutants include fertiliz-ers and pesticides, bacteria from livestock and food-processing wastes, and excess salts from soils of irrigated cropland. Industrial facilities, which emit a variety of harmful chemicals, are a second major source of water pollution. Mining is the third biggest source of water pollution. Sur -\nface mining disturbs the land, creating major erosion of sediments and runoff of toxic chemicals.\nAnother form of water pollution is caused by the \nwidespread use of human-made materials such as plastics used to make millions of products. Much of the plastic that is improperly discarded eventually winds up in wa-terways (see Figure 1.9, p. 11) and in the oceans. Such \ndiscarded plastic products can harm various forms of wild-life (Figure 11.23).\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Atmospheric Warming  \nand Water Pollution\nProjected climate change from atmospheric warming will likely contribute to \nwater pollution in some areas of the globe. In a warmer world, some regions will get more precipitation and other areas will get less. More intense down-pours will flush more harmful chemicals, plant nutrients, and disease-causing microorganisms into some waterways. In other areas, prolonged drought will reduce river flows that dilute wastes.\nOne of the major water pollution problems that we face \nis exposure to infectious bacteria, viruses, and parasites that \ncan be transferred into water from the wastes of humans and other animals. The WHO estimates that each year, more than 1.6 million people die from largely preventable waterborne infectious diseases that they get by drinking contaminated water or by not having enough clean water for adequate hygiene. Every 18 seconds, a young child somewhere in the world dies from diarrhea caused by drinking contaminated water, according to the WHO.

Question: What would be the effect of putting another discharge pipe emitting biodegradable waste to the right of the one in this picture?\n\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\nLaws enacted in the 1970s to control water pollution \nhave led to a greatly increased number of facilities that treat \nwastewater\u2014water that contains sewage and other wastes from homes and industries\u2014in the United States and in most other more-developed countries. Such laws also require industries to reduce or eliminate their point-source discharges of harmful chemicals into surface waters. This is an impressive accomplishment given the country\u2019s increased economic activity, resource consumption, and population growth since the passage of these laws.\nIn most less-developed countries, stream pollution \nfrom discharges of untreated sewage, industrial wastes, and discarded trash is a serious and growing problem. Ac-cording to the Global Water Policy Project, most cities in less-developed countries discharge 80\u201390% of their un-treated sewage directly into rivers, streams, and lakes whose waters are often used also for drinking, bathing, and washing clothes.\nAccording to the World Commission on Water for the \n21st Century, half of the world\u2019s 500 major rivers are heav-ily polluted, with most of these polluted waterways run-ning through less-developed countries. A majority of these countries cannot afford to build waste treatment plants and do not have, or do not enforce, laws for controlling water pollution.A 2009 study by the National Academy of Sciences \nranked the following pollutants as the most serious threats to U.S. stream and lake water quality. In decreasing order, they are: mercury, pathogens from leaking sewer pipes, sediment from land disturbance and stream erosion, met-als other than mercury, and nutrients that cause oxygen depletion.\nStreams Can Cleanse Themselves, If We Do \nNot Overload Them\nFlowing rivers and streams can recover rapidly from mod-\nerate levels of degradable, oxygen-demanding wastes through a combination of dilution and bacterial biodegra-dation of such wastes. But this natural recovery process does not work when a stream becomes overloaded with such pollutants or when drought, damming, or water di-version reduces its flow (Concept 11.4). Also, while this process can remove biodegradable wastes, it does not elimi-nate slowly degradable and nondegradable pollutants.\nIn a flowing stream, the breakdown of biodegradable \nwastes by bacteria depletes dissolved oxygen and creates an oxygen sag curve (Figure 11.24).

According to the Minis-try of Environmental Protec-tion, some 380 million Chinese people drink unsafe water and nearly half of China\u2019s rivers carry water that is too toxic to touch, much less drink.\nLakes and Reservoirs Are Especially \nVulnerable to Water Pollution\nLakes and reservoirs are generally less effective at diluting \npollutants than streams are, for two reasons. First, lakes and reservoirs often contain stratified layers (see Figure 7.26, p. 152) that undergo little vertical mixing. Second, they have low flow rates or no flow at all. The flushing and changing of water in lakes and large artificial reservoirs can take from 1 to 100 years, compared with several days to several weeks for streams.\nAs a result, lakes and reservoirs are more vulnerable \nthan streams are to contamination by runoff or discharges of plant nutrients, oil, pesticides, and nondegradable toxic substances, such as lead, mercury, and arsenic. Many toxic chemicals and acids also enter lakes and reservoirs from the atmosphere.\nEutrophication is the name given to the natural nu-\ntrient enrichment of a shallow lake, a coastal area at the mouth of a river, or a slow-moving stream. It is caused mostly by runoff of plant nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates from land bordering such bodies of water. An oligotrophic lake is low in nutrients and its water is clear (see Figure 7.27, p. 153). Over time, some lakes become more eutrophic (see Figure 7.28, p. 154) as nutrients are added from natural and human sources in the surround-ing watersheds.\nNear urban or agricultural areas, human activities can \ngreatly accelerate the input of plant nutrients to a lake\u2014a process called cultural eutrophication. Such inputs in-volve mostly nitrate- and phosphate-containing effluents from various sources, including farmland, feedlots, urban streets and parking lots, chemically fertilized lawns, mining sites, and municipal sewage treatment plants. Some nitro-gen also reaches lakes by deposition from the atmosphere.\nDuring hot weather or drought, this nutrient overload \ncan produce dense growths, or \u201cblooms,\u201d of organisms such as algae and cyanobacteria (see Figure 7.28, p. 154). When the algae die, they are decomposed by swelling populations of oxygen-consuming bacteria, which deplete dissolved oxygen in the surface layer of water near the shore as well as in the bottom layer of a lake or coastal area. This can kill fish, shellfish, and other aerobic aquatic animals that cannot move to safer waters. If excess nutri-ents continue to flow into a lake, bacteria that don\u2019t re-quire oxygen take over and produce gaseous products such as smelly, highly toxic hydrogen sulfide and flam-mable methane.\nAccording to the EPA, about one-third of the 100,000 \nmedium to large lakes and 85% of the large lakes near major U. S. population centers have some degree of cul-tural eutrophication. The International Water Association estimates that more than half of the lakes in China suffer from cultural eutrophication (Figure 11.25).\nThere are several ways to prevent or reduce cultural eu-\ntrophication. We can use advanced (but expensive) waste treatment processes to remove nitrates and phosphates from wastewater before it enters a body of water. Then we can mimic the earth\u2019s natural cycling of nutrients by \n recycling them to the soil instead of dumping them into \nFIGURE 11.25   Severe cultural eutro-\nphication of Chao Lake in China.\nYang", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3605, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14514c6e-e983-4afa-893b-b8ad630296c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "14514c6e-e983-4afa-893b-b8ad630296c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "271", "file_name": "G.

Ground-water contamination could result from leaky gas well pipes and pipefittings and from contaminated wastewater brought to the surface during fracking operations.\nWhen groundwater becomes contaminated, it cannot \ncleanse itself of degradable wastes as quickly as flowing surface water can. Groundwater flows so slowly that con-taminants are not diluted and dispersed effectively. In ad-dition, groundwater usually has much lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen (which helps decompose many con-taminants) and smaller populations of decomposing bacte-ria. And the usually cold temperatures of groundwater slow down chemical reactions that decompose wastes.\nThus, it can take decades to thousands of years for \ncontaminated groundwater to cleanse itself of slowly de-gradable wastes (such as DDT). On a human time scale, nondegradable wastes (such as toxic lead and arsenic) re-main in the water permanently.\nGroundwater Pollution Is a Serious Hidden \nThreat in Some Areas\nOn a global scale, we do not know much about groundwa-\nter pollution because few countries go to the great expense of locating and tracking pollutants and testing aquifers. But the results of scientific studies in scattered parts of the world are alarming.\nFor example, in 2010, about 90% of China\u2019s shallow \ngroundwater was polluted with chemicals such as toxic heavy metals, organic solvents, nitrates, petrochemicals, and pesticides, according to the Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources. About 37% of this groundwater is so pol-luted that it cannot even be treated for use as drinking water. China has more than 200 \u201ccancer villages\u201d located near mines and factories where cancer rates are far above the national average. Some researchers say there may be more than 400 such villages.\nIn the United States, an EPA survey of 26,000 industrial \nwaste ponds and lagoons found that one-third of them had no liners to prevent toxic liquid wastes from seeping into aquifers. One-third of these sites are within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of a drinking water well. In addition, almost two-thirds of the country\u2019s liquid hazardous wastes are injected into the ground in disposal wells (Figure 11.26). Leaking injection pipes and seals in such wells can contaminate aquifers used as sources of drinking water.\nThe EPA has overseen the cleanup of about 357,000 of \nthe more than 479,000 underground tanks in the United States that were leaking gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, or toxic solvents into groundwater. During this century, scientists expect many of the millions of such tanks, which have been installed around the world, to become corroded and leaky, possibly contaminating groundwater and be-coming a major global health problem. Determining the extent of a leak from a single underground tank can cost $25,000\u2013$250,000, and cleanup costs range from $10,000 to more than $250,000.\nIf the chemical reaches an aquifer, effective cleanup is \noften not possible or is too costly. Although there are ways to clean up contaminated groundwater (Figure 11.27, right), such methods are very expensive. Cleaning up a single contaminated aquifer can cost anywhere from $10 million to $10 billion. Thus, preventing groundwater con-tamination (Figure 11.27, left) is the only effective way to deal with this serious water pollution problem.\nThere Are Many Ways to Purify  \nDrinking Water\nMost of", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3813, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be8cf120-534b-47c0-bb81-f0422dd963f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "be8cf120-534b-47c0-bb81-f0422dd963f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "273", "file_name": "G.

Several major U.S. cities, including New York City, Boston, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon, have avoided building expensive wa-ter treatment facilities and increased their beneficial envi-ronmental impact by investing in protection of the forests and wetlands in the watersheds that provide their water supplies.\nWe have the technology to convert sewer water into \npure drinking water. One such process involves microfil-tration to remove bacteria and suspended solids; reverse osmosis to remove minerals, viruses, and various organic compounds; and hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet light to remove additional organic compounds. In a world where we will face increasing shortages of drinking water, wastewater purification is likely to become a major growth business. \nGREEN CAREER:  Wastewater purification\nIn most places, the reclamation of wastewater still faces \nopposition from citizens and from some health officials who are unaware of the advances in this technology. How -\never, the California cities of Los Angeles and San Diego are purifying wastewater to the point where it is fit to drink GOOD\nNEWSand putting this water into underlying aquifers, \nthereby reducing their dependence on water im-ported from Northern California (Figure 11.13) and from the Colorado River (Core Case Study).\nWe can also use simpler measures to purify drinking \nwater. In tropical countries that lack centralized water treatment systems, the WHO urges people to purify drink-ing water by exposing a clear plastic bottle filled with con-taminated water to intense sunlight. The sun\u2019s heat and ultraviolet (UV) rays can kill infectious microbes in as little as 3 hours. Painting one side of the bottle black can im-prove heat absorption in this simple solar disinfection method, which applies the solar energy principle of sustainability. Where this simple measure has been used, the incidence of dangerous childhood diarrhea has decreased by 30\u201340%. Researchers have found that they can speed up this disinfection process by adding lime juice to the bottles of water.\nDanish inventor Torben Vestergaard Frandsen has de-\nveloped the LifeStraw\u2122, an inexpensive, portable water filter that eliminates many viruses and parasites from wa-ter that is drawn through it (Figure 11.28). This filter has been particularly useful in Africa, where aid agencies are \nFIGURE 11.28   The LifeStraw\u2122 is a personal water purification device that gives many poor people \naccess to safe drinking water. here, four young men in Uganda demonstrate its use.

Another option being used by more and \nmore people around the world is bottled water, which has created or worsened some environmental problems (see the following Case Study).\nCASE STUDY\nIs Bottled Water a Good Option?\nBottled water can be a useful (but expensive) option in countries and areas where people do not have access to safe and clean drinking water. However, despite some problems, experts say the United States has some of the world\u2019s cleanest drinking water. Municipal water systems in the United States are required to test their water regu-larly for a number of pollutants and to make the results available to citizens.\nYet about half of all Americans worry about getting \nsick from tap water contaminants, and many drink high-priced bottled water or install expensive water purification systems. Studies by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveal that in the United States, a bottle of water costs between 240 and 10,000 times as much as the same volume of tap water. Water expert Peter Gleick has esti-mated that more than 40% of the expensive bottled water that Americans drink is really bottled tap water. And a 4-year study by the NRDC found bacteria and synthetic organic chemicals in one-third of the bottles tested. EPA contamination standards that apply to public water sup-plies do not apply to bottled water.\nUse of bottled water also causes environmental prob-\nlems. In the United States, according to the Container Recy-cling Institute, more than 67 million plastic water bottles are discarded every day\u2014enough bottles in a year to wrap around the planet at its equator about 280 times, if lined up end-to-end. Most water bottles are made of recyclable plas-tic, but in the United States, only about 29% of these bottles get recycled. The billions of discarded bottles end up in landfills, where they can remain for hundreds of years, or are burned in incinerators, which release some of their harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. Even worse, mil-lions get scattered on the land and end up in rivers, lakes, and oceans. By contrast, in Germany most bottled water is sold in returnable and reusable glass bottles.\nIt takes huge amounts of energy to manufacture bottled \nwater and to transport it across countries and around the world, as well as to refrigerate much of it in stores. Toxic gases and liquids are released during the manufacture of plastic water bottles, and greenhouse gases and other air pollutants are emitted by the fossil fuels burned to make them and to deliver bottled water to suppliers. According to the Pacific Institute, the oil used to pump, process, bottle, transport, and refrigerate the bottled water used annually in the United States would be enough to fuel 3 million cars for a year. In addition, withdrawing ground-water for bottling is helping to deplete some aquifers.Because of these harmful environmental impacts and \nthe high cost of bottled water, there is a growing back-to-the-tap movement. From San Francisco to New York to Paris, city governments, restaurants, schools, religious groups, and many consumers are refusing to buy bottled water. People are also refilling portable bottles with tap water and using simple filters to improve the taste and color of water where necessary. Some health officials sug-gest that before drinking expensive bottled water or buy-ing costly home water purifiers, consumers have their water tested by local health departments or private labs (but not by companies trying to sell water purification equipment).\nOcean Pollution Is a Growing and Poorly \nUnderstood Problem\nWhy should we care about the oceans? Short answer: Be-\ncause they keep us alive. Oceans help to provide and re-cycle the planet\u2019s freshwater through the water cycle (see Figure 3.13, p. 52).

As oceanographer and ex-plorer Sylvia A. Earle (see Individuals Matter 9.1, p. 209) reminds us: \u201cEven if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean, the ocean touches you with every breath you take, every drop of water you drink, every bite you consume. Everyone, everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea.\u201d Despite its importance, we treat the ocean as the world\u2019s largest dump for the massive and growing amount of wastes and pollutants that we produce.\nCoastal areas\u2014especially wetlands, estuaries, coral \nreefs, and mangrove swamps\u2014bear the brunt of our in-puts of pollutants and wastes into the ocean (Figure 11.29). Roughly 40% of the world\u2019s people (53% in the United States) live on or near coastlines, which helps ex-plain why 80% of marine pollution originates on land; and coastal populations are projected to double by 2050.\nAccording to a study by the U.N. Environment Pro-\ngramme (UNEP), 80\u201390% of the municipal sewage from coastal areas of less-developed countries is dumped into oceans without treatment. This often overwhelms the abil-ity of the coastal waters to degrade the wastes. By adding excessive amounts of nitrates and phosphates to the ocean instead of recycling these vital plant nutrients to the soil, this activity alters the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and upsets marine ecosystems. For example, many areas of China\u2019s coastline are so choked with algae growing on the nutrients provided by sewage that some scientists have concluded that large areas of China\u2019s coastal waters can no longer sustain marine ecosystems. The dumping of wastes in coastal waters is a serious violation of the chemi-cal cycling principle of sustainability.\n90446_ch11_248-287.indd   275 8/13/14   8:49 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Some scientists suggest that it is safer to dump sewage sludge, toxic mining wastes, and most other harmful wastes into the deep ocean than to bury them on land or burn them in incinerators. Other scientists disagree, pointing out that dumping harmful wastes into the ocean would delay urgently needed pollu-tion prevention measures and promote further degrada-tion of this vital part of the earth\u2019s life-support system.\nRecent studies of some U.S. coastal waters have found \nvast colonies of viruses thriving in raw sewage and in efflu-ents from sewage treatment plants (which do not remove viruses) and leaking septic tanks. According to one study, one-fourth of the people using coastal beaches in the United States develop ear infections, sore throats, eye irritations, respiratory diseases, or gastrointestinal diseases from swim-ming in seawater containing infectious viruses and bacteria.\nScientists also point to the underreported problem of \npollution from cruise ships. A cruise liner can carry as many as 6,300 passengers and 2,300 crewmembers, and it can generate as much waste (toxic chemicals, garbage, sewage, and waste oil) as a small city. Many cruise ships dump these wastes at sea. In U.S. waters, such dumping is illegal, but some ships continue dumping secretively, usu-ally at night. Some environmentally aware vacationers are refusing to go on cruise ships that do not have sophisti-cated systems for dealing with the wastes they produce.\nRunoff of sewage and agricultural wastes into coastal \nwaters introduces large quantities of nitrate (NO\n3\u2212) and \nOxygen-depleted zoneClosed\nbeachClosedshell/f_ish bedsIndustryNitrogen oxidesfrom autos andsmokestacks,toxic chemicals,and heavy metals inef/f_luents /f_low intobays and estuaries.CitiesToxic metals andoil from streets andparking lots pollutewaters; sewageadds nitrogen andphosphorus.Urban sprawlBacteria and viruses fromsewers and septic tankscontaminate shell/f_ish bedsand close beaches; runoff offertilizer from lawns addsnitrogen and phosphorus.Construction sitesSediments are washed intowaterways, choking /f_ish and plants,clouding waters, and blocking sunlight.\nFarmsRunoff of pesticides, manure, andfertilizers adds toxins and excessnitrogen and phosphorus.\nRed tides\nExcess nitrogen causes explosivegrowth of toxic microscopic algae,poisoning /f_ish and marine mammals.\nToxic sedimentsChemicals and toxic metalscontaminate shell/f_ish beds,kill spawning /f_ish, andaccumulate in the tissuesof bottom feeders.\nOxygen-depleted zoneSedimentation and algaeovergrowth reduce sunlight,kill bene/f_icial sea grasses, useup oxygen, cause /f_ish kills, anddegrade habitat.Healthy zoneClear, oxygen-rich waterspromote growth of planktonand sea grasses, and support /f_ish.\nFIGURE 11.29   Natural capital degradation: Residential areas, factories, and farms all contribute to \nthe pollution of coastal waters.

An estimated one-third to one-half of all ocean oil pollution comes from oil and oil products that are intentionally dumped or accidentally spilled or leaked onto the land or into sewers by home-owners and industries.\nVolatile organic hydrocarbons in oil and other petro-\nleum products kill many aquatic organisms immediately upon contact, especially if these animals are in their vulner -\nable larval forms. Other chemicals in oil form tarlike globs that float on the surface and coat the feathers of seabirds and the fur of marine mammals (Figure 11.30), which de-stroys their natural heat insulation and buoyancy, causing many of them to drown or die from loss of body heat.Heavy oil components that sink to the ocean floor or \nwash into estuaries and coastal wetlands can smother bottom-dwelling organisms such as crabs, oysters, mus-sels, and clams, or make them unfit for human consump-tion. Some oil spills have killed coral reefs.\nResearch shows that populations of many forms of ma-\nrine life can recover from exposure to large amounts of crude oil in warm waters with fairly rapid currents within about 3 years. But in cold and calm waters, recovery can take decades. In addition, recovery from exposure to refined oil, especially in estuaries and salt marshes, can take 10\u201320 years or longer. Oil slicks that wash onto beaches can have a serious economic impact on coastal residents, who lose income normally gained from fishing and tourist activities.\nSome oil spills that are not too large can be partially \ncleaned up by mechanical means, including floating \nThe Mississippi River basin (Figure \n11.A, map) lies within 31 states and \ncontains almost two-thirds of the con-tinental U.S. land area.

One of the best ways to prevent tanker spills is to use oil tankers with double hulls. Stricter safety standards and inspections could help to reduce oil well blowouts at sea. Most impor -\ntant, businesses, institutions, and citizens living in coastal areas must take care to prevent leaks and spillage of even the smallest amounts of oil and oil products such as paint thinners and gasoline.\nMost ocean pollution occurs in coastal waters and comes \nfrom human activities on land.

How could you reduce your contribution to this environmental problem?\nReducing Surface Water Pollution from \nNonpoint Sources\nThere are a number of ways to reduce nonpoint sources of \nsurface water pollution, most of which come from agricul-tural practices. Farmers can reduce soil erosion by keeping cropland covered with vegetation and using conservation tillage and other soil conservation methods (see Chapter 10, pp. 238\u2013239). They can also reduce the amount of fer -\ntilizer that runs off into surface waters by using slow-release \nFIGURE 11.B   The \ncolorized area in this \nsatellite image of the northern Gulf of Mex-ico represents the seasonal dead zone of 2012 with the red area having the low-est oxygen level.\nTexasLouisiana\nMississippi RiverMississippi\nGULF OF\nMEXICONOAAMississippi River basin, can also kill \nbottom-dwelling forms of animal aquatic life. The dead zone appears each spring and grows until fall when storms churn the water and redistrib-ute dissolved oxygen to the Gulf bottom.\nThe size of the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s an-\nnual dead zone depends primarily on the amount of water flowing into the Mississippi River each year. In years with ample rainfall and snowmelt, such as 2003, it has covered an area as large as the state of Massachu-setts\u201427,300 square kilometers (10,600 square miles). In 2013, a se-vere drought year in parts of the coun-try, it covered a smaller area of about 15,125 square kilometers (5,840 square miles)\u2014about the size of the state of Connecticut.\nThe annual Gulf of Mexico dead \nzone (one of about 400 dead zones found throughout the world) repre-sents a disruption of the nitrogen cycle (see Figure 3.15, p. 54) caused primar -\nily by human activities. It happens be-cause huge quantities of nitrogen from nitrate fertilizers are added to ecosys-tems such as the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico much faster than the nitrogen cycle can remove them. As a result, by producing crops for food and ethanol to fuel cars in the vast Missis-sippi basin, we end up disrupting coastal aquatic life and seafood pro-duction in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBecause of the size and agricultural \nimportance of the Mississippi River ba-sin, there is no easy solution to the problem of severe cultural eutrophica-tion of this coastal zone.

Farmers can reduce pesticide runoff by applying pesticides only when needed and by relying more on integrated pest manage-ment (see Chapter 10, p. 235). In addition, they can con-trol runoff and infiltration of manure from animal feedlots by planting buffer zones and by locating feedlots, pastures, and animal waste storage sites away from steeply sloped land, surface water, and flood zones. All of these are ways to have a beneficial environmental impact.\nLaws Can Be Used to Reduce Water \nPollution from Point Sources\nThe Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (renamed \nthe Clean Water Act when it was amended in 1977) and the 1987 Water Quality Act form the basis of U.S. efforts to control pollution of the country\u2019s surface waters. The Clean Water Act sets standards for allowed levels of 100 key water pollutants and requires polluters to get permits that limit how much of these various pollutants they can discharge into aquatic systems.\nThe EPA has also been experimenting with a discharge \ntrading policy, which uses market forces to reduce water pollution in the United States. Under this program, a per -mit holder can pollute at higher levels than allowed in its permit if it buys credits from permit holders who are pol-luting below their allowed levels.\nEnvironmental scientists warn that the effectiveness \nof such a system depends on how low the cap on total pollution levels in any given area is set and on how regu-larly the cap is lowered. They also warn that discharge trading could allow water pollutants to build up to \n dangerous levels in areas where credits are bought. Nei-ther adequate scrutiny of the cap levels nor gradual low-ering of caps is a part of the current EPA discharge trading system.\nSome environmental and health scientists call for \nstrengthening the U.S. Clean Water Act. Suggested im-provements include shifting the focus of the law from end-of-pipe removal of specific pollutants to water pollution prevention; greatly increased monitoring for violations of the law and much larger mandatory fines for violators; and regulating irrigation water quality (for which there is no federal regulation). Another suggestion is to expand the rights of citizens to bring lawsuits to ensure that water pollution laws are enforced. Still another suggestion is to rewrite the Clean Water Act to clarify that it covers all waterways. This was the original intent of the law, but it has since been muddled by court decisions, and some pol-luters have taken advantage of the resulting confusion to keep polluting in many areas.\nMany people oppose these proposals, contending that \nthe Clean Water Act\u2019s regulations are already too restric-tive and costly. Some state and local officials argue that in many communities, it is unnecessary and too expensive to test all the water for pollutants as required by federal law.FIGURE 11.31   Methods for preventing \nexcessive pollution of coastal waters and \nmethods for cleaning it up (Concept 11.4).

In 2012, William K. Reilly, who headed the EPA from 1989 to 1993 and served as the co-chairman of a presidential commission on offshore drilling, said: \u201cIf we buy into the misguided notion that reducing protection of our waters will somehow ignite the econ-omy, we will shortchange our health, environment, and economy.\u201d\nSewage Treatment Reduces  \nWater Pollution\nIn rural and suburban areas with suitable soils, sewage from \neach house usually is discharged into a septic tank with a large drainage field. In such a system, household sewage and wastewater is pumped into a settling tank, where grease and oil rise to the top, and solids fall to the bottom and are decomposed by bacteria. The partially treated wastewater that results is discharged into a large drainage (absorption) field through small holes in perforated pipes embedded in porous gravel or crushed stone just below the soil\u2019s surface. As these wastes drain from the pipes and percolate down-ward, the soil filters out some potential pollutants and soil bacteria decompose biodegradable materials. About one-fourth of all homes in the United States are served by septic tanks. They work well as long as they are not overloaded and their solid wastes are regularly pumped out.\nIn urban areas in the United States and other more-\ndeveloped countries, most waterborne wastes from homes, businesses, and storm runoff flow through a network of sewer pipes to wastewater or sewage treatment plants. Raw sewage reaching a treatment plant typically undergoes one or two levels of wastewater treatment. The first is pri-mary sewage treatment\u2014a physical process that uses \nscreens and a grit tank to remove large floating objects and to allow solids such as sand and rock to settle out. Then the waste stream flows into a primary settling tank where suspended solids settle out as sludge (Figure 11.32, left).\nThe second level is secondary sewage treatment\u2014a \nbiological process in which aerobic bacteria remove as much as 90% of dissolved and biodegradable, oxygen-demanding organic wastes (Figure 11.32, right). A combi-nation of primary and secondary treatment removes 95\u201397% of the suspended solids and oxygen-demanding organic wastes, 70% of most toxic metal compounds and nonpersistent synthetic organic chemicals, 70% of the phosphorus, and 50% of the nitrogen. However, this pro-cess removes only a tiny fraction of persistent and poten-tially toxic organic substances found in some pesticides and in discarded medicines that people put into sewage systems, and it does not kill pathogens.\nBefore discharge, water from sewage treatment plants \nusually undergoes bleaching, to remove water coloration, and disinfection to kill disease-carrying bacteria and some \nPrimary Secondary\nGrit chamber Bar screen Settling tank Aeration tank Settling tankChlorine\ndisinfection tank\nRaw sewagefrom sewersSludge (kills bacteria)To river, lake,\nor ocean\nAir pump\nSludge digester\nSludge drying bedDisposed of inland/f_ill or ocean orapplied to cr opland,\npastur e, or rangelandActivated sludge\nFIGURE 11.32   Solutions: Primary and secondary sewage treat-\nment systems help to reduce water pollution.

Biologist John Todd has devel-oped an ecological approach to treat-ing sewage, which he calls living machines (Figure 11.C).\nThis purification process begins \nwhen sewage flows into a passive solar greenhouse or outdoor site containing rows of large open tanks populated by an increasingly complex series of or -\nganisms. In the first set of tanks, algae and microorganisms decompose or -\nganic wastes, with sunlight speeding up the process. Water hyacinths, cat-tails, bulrushes, and other aquatic plants growing in the tanks take up the resulting nutrients.\nAfter flowing though several of \nthese natural purification tanks, the water passes through an artificial marsh made of sand, gravel, and bulrushes, which filters out algae and remaining organic waste. Some of the plants also absorb, or sequester, toxic metals such as lead and mercury and secrete natural antibiotic compounds that kill pathogens.\nNext, the water flows into aquarium \ntanks, where snails and zooplankton consume microorganisms and are in turn consumed by crayfish, tilapia, and other fish that can be eaten or sold as bait. After 10 days, the clear water flows into a second artificial marsh for final filtering and cleansing. The water can be made pure enough to drink by treating it with ultraviolet light or by passing the water through an ozone generator, usually immersed out of sight in an attractive pond or wetland habitat. Operating costs are about the same as those of a conventional sew-age treatment plant. These systems are widely used on a small scale. \nhowever, TREATING SEWAGE BY WORKING WITH NATURE\nthey have been difficult to maintain on a scale large enough to handle the typ-ical variety of chemicals in the sewage wastes from more-developed urban areas.\nMore than 800 cities and towns \naround the world (150 in the United States) use natural or artificially created wetlands to treat sewage as a lower-cost alternative to expensive waste treatment plants. For example, in Ar -\ncata, California\u2014a coastal town of 18,000 people\u2014scientists and workers created some 65 hectares (160 acres) of wetlands between the town and the adjacent \nhumboldt Bay. The marshes \nand ponds, developed on land that was once a dump, act as a natural waste treatment plant. The project cost was less than half the estimated price of a conventional treatment plant.\nThis system returns purified water \nto \nhumboldt Bay, and the sludge that \nis removed is processed for use as fer -\ntilizer. The marshes and ponds also serve as an Audubon Society bird sanc-tuary, which provides habitats for thou-sands of seabirds, otters, and other marine animals. The town has even celebrated its natural sewage treat-ment system with an annual \u201cFlush with Pride\u201d festival.\nThis approach and the living ma-\nchine system developed by John Todd apply all three scientific principles of sustainability: using solar energy, em-ploying natural processes to remove and recycle nutrients and other chemi-cals, and relying on a diversity of  \norganisms and natural processes.\nCritical Thinking\nCan you think of any disadvantages of using such a nature-based system in-stead of a conventional sewage treat-ment plant? Do you think any such disadvantages outweigh the advan-tages?

The usual method for accomplishing \nthis is chlorination. But chlorine can react with organic ma-terials in water to form small amounts of chlorinated hy-drocarbons. Some of these chemicals cause cancers in test animals, can increase the risk of miscarriages, and can damage the human nervous, immune, and endocrine sys-tems. Use of other disinfectants, such as ozone and ultra-violet light, is increasing, but they cost more and their effects do not last as long as those of chlorination.\nWe Can Improve Conventional Sewage \nTreatment and Emphasize  Nutrient Recovery\nSome scientists call for redesigning the conventional sew-\nage treatment system shown in Figure 11.32. The idea is to prevent toxic and hazardous chemicals from reaching sewage treatment plants and thus from getting into sludge and water discharged from such plants.\nThey suggest several ways to implement this pollution \nprevention approach. One is to require industries and businesses to remove toxic and hazardous wastes from water sent to municipal sewage treatment plants, which would help to implement the full-cost pricing prin-ciple of sustainability by increasing the cost of creating waste and pollution. We could also encourage industries to reduce or eliminate their use and waste of toxic chemicals, which would reduce their expense in complying with water pollution control laws.\nAnother suggestion is to require or encourage more \nhouseholds, apartment buildings, and offices to eliminate sewage outputs by switching to waterless, odorless com-posting toilet systems, to be installed, maintained, and man-aged by professionals. These systems, pioneered several decades ago in Sweden, convert nutrient-rich human fecal matter into a soil-like humus that can be used as a fertil-izer supplement. This process returns plant nutrients in human waste to the soil, mimicking the chemical cycling principle of sustainability.\nOn a larger scale, such systems would be cheaper to \ninstall and maintain than current sewage systems are, be-cause they do not require vast systems of underground pipes connected to centralized sewage treatment plants. They also save large amounts of water, reduce water bills, and decrease the amount of energy used to pump and purify water. This more environmentally sustainable re-placement for the conventional toilet is now being used in parts of more than a dozen countries, including China, India, Mexico, Syria, and South Africa.\nA Swedish entrepreneur has developed a biodegradable \nsingle-use plastic bag that can be used as a toilet in urban slums and in other areas where many of the world\u2019s people do not have access to toilets. After it is used, the bag is knot-ted and buried.

These improvements were largely the result of bottom-up political pressure on elected officials from individuals and groups. On the other hand, little has been done to reduce water pollution in most of the less-developed countries.\nMany environmental and health scientists argue that \nthe next step is to increase efforts to reduce and prevent water pollution in both more- and less-developed coun-tries as an important way to increase our beneficial envi-ronmental impact. They would begin by asking the question: How can we avoid producing water pollutants in the \nfirst place? (Concept 11.4). Figure 11.33 lists ways to achieve this goal over the next several decades.\nThis shift to pollution prevention will not take place \nunless citizens put political pressure on elected officials and also take actions to reduce their own daily contribu-tions to water pollution. Figure 11.34 lists some actions you can take to help reduce water pollution.GOOD\nNEWS\n90446_ch11_248-287.indd   283 8/13/14   8:49 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Such problems are representative of those faced in many other dry regions of the world, espe-cially areas where the population is growing rapidly and water resources are dwindling for various reasons.\nLarge dams, river diversions, levees, water transfers, and \nother big engineering schemes have helped to provide much of the world with electricity, food from irrigated crops, drink-ing water, and flood control. \nhowever, they have also de-\ngraded the aquatic natural capital necessary for long-term economic and ecological sustainability by seriously disrupting rivers, streams, wetlands, aquifers, and other aquatic systems. We are also degrading aquatic natural capital by polluting much of the world\u2019s rivers, lakes, oceans, and aquifers.\nThe three scientific principles of sustainability can \nguide us in using water resources more sustainably and  \nin reducing and preventing water pollution. Scientists  \nhope to use solar energy to desalinate water and expand freshwater supplies and to purify much of the water we use. Purifying and recycling more water will help us to reduce wa-ter waste. We can use natural nutrient cycling to treat our wastes in wetland-based sewage treatment systems and to remove nitrate and phosphate plant nutrients from sewage and recycle them to the soil. By sustaining water supplies and avoiding the pollution of aquatic systems and their bordering terrestrial systems, we can preserve biodiversity and its ecosys-tem services\u2014a key factor in maintaining water supplies and water quality.TYING  IT All TOGETHER\nThe Colorado River, Sustainability, and Reducing Water Pollution\nAtm2003/Shutterstock.com\nReducing Water Pollution\n/uni25A0 Fertilize garden and yard plants with manure or compost   \n instead of commercial inorganic fertilizer\n/uni25A0 Minimize use of pesticides, especially near bodies of water/uni25A0 Prevent yard wastes from entering storm drains/uni25A0 Do not use water fresheners in toilets/uni25A0 Do not /f_lush unwanted medicines down the toilet/uni25A0 Do not pour pesticides, paints, solvents, oil, antifreeze, or   \n other harmful chemicals down the drain or onto the groundWhat Can You Do?\nFIGURE 11.34   Individuals matter: You can help reduce water pollu-\ntion.

But people are generally much less aware of the rare earth metals and oxides, some of which are crucial to the major technologies that support today\u2019s lifestyles and economies.\nThe 17 rare earth metals, also \nknown as rare earths, include scan-dium, yttrium, and 15 lanthanide chemical elements, including lantha-num (see Figure 12.1 and the Periodic Table in Figure 1, p. S5, Supplement 3). Because of their superior magnetic strength and other unique properties, these elements and their compounds are very important for a number of widely used technologies.\nRare earths are used to make liquid \ncrystal display flat screens for comput-ers and television sets, energy-efficient compact fluorescent and LED light bulbs, solar cells, fiber-optic cables, cell phones, and digital cameras.

The outermost part of the mantle is solid rock, and under that part is a zone called the asthenosphere\u2014a volume of hot, partly melted rock \nthat flows. Tremendous heat within the core and mantle generate convection cells or currents that slowly move large \nvolumes of rock and heat in loops within the mantle like gigantic conveyer belts (Figure 12.3). Some of the molten rock in the asthenosphere flows upward into the crust, where it is referred to as magma.\nThe outermost and thinnest zone of solid material is \nthe earth\u2019s crust. It consists of the continental crust, which \nunderlies the continents (including the continental shelves extending into the oceans), and the oceanic crust, which underlies the ocean basins and makes up 71% of the earth\u2019s crust. The combination of the crust and the rigid, outermost part of the mantle is called the lithosphere. It is in this zone that we find the mineral resources on which we depend (Concept 12.1A).\nWhat Are Minerals and Rocks?\nThe earth\u2019s crust beneath our feet consists mostly of min-erals and rocks. A mineral is a naturally occurring chemi-cal element or inorganic compound that exists as a solid with a regularly repeating internal arrangement of its at-oms or ions (a crystalline solid). A mineral resource is a concentration of one or more minerals in the earth\u2019s crust that we can extract and process into raw materials and useful products at an affordable cost. Because minerals take millions of year to form, they are nonrenewable re-sources, and their supplies can be depleted (Concept 12.1B).\nA few minerals consist of a single chemical element. \nThey include gold (see Figure 2.3, right, p. 29) and rare earth metals (Core Case Study) such as lanthanum (Figure 12.1). However, most of the more than 2,000 identified mineral resources that we use occur as inorganic com-pounds formed by various combinations of elements. Ex-amples include salt (sodium chloride, or NaCl; see Figure 2, p. S6, in Supplement 3) quartz (silicon dioxide, or SiO\n2), \nand rare earth oxides (formed when rare earth metals combine with oxygen).\nRock is a solid combination of one or more minerals \nfound in the earth\u2019s crust. Some kinds of rock such as lime-stone (calcium carbonate, or CaCO\n3) and quartzite (silicon \ndioxide, or SiO 2) contain only one mineral. But most rocks \nconsist of two or more minerals. For example, granite is a mixture of mica, feldspar, and quartz crystals. Deposits of rare earths (Core Case Study) typically contain a mixture of the metals and their oxides that are difficult and costly to sepa-rate from one another and to purify to an acceptable level.\nBased on the way it forms, rock is placed in three broad \nclasses: sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic. Sedimen-tary rock is made of sediments\u2014dead plant and animal \nremains and tiny particles of weathered and eroded rocks. These sediments are transported by water, wind, or gravity to downstream, downwind, downhill, or underwater sites. There they are deposited in layers that accumulate over time. Eventually, the increasing weight and pressure on the underlying layers convert the sedimentary layers to rock. Examples include sandstone and shale (formed from pressure created by deposited layers made primarily of sand), dolomite and limestone (formed from the compacted \nshells, skeletons, and other remains of dead aquatic organ-isms), and lignite and bituminous coal (derived from com-pacted plant", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3588, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e4d8288-14a2-46e6-a93e-3118ab5605b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e4d8288-14a2-46e6-a93e-3118ab5605b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "292", "file_name": "G.

Ex-amples include granite (formed underground) and lava rock (formed aboveground). Igneous rock forms the bulk of the earth\u2019s crust but is usually covered by sedimentary rock.\nMetamorphic rock forms when an existing rock is \nsubjected to high temperatures (which may cause it to melt partially), high pressures, chemically active fluids, or a combination of these agents. Examples include slate (formed when shale and mudstone are heated) and marble (pro-duced when limestone is exposed to heat and pressure).\nThe Earth\u2019s Rocks Are Recycled Very Slowly\nThe interaction of physical and chemical processes that change the earth\u2019s rocks from one type to another is called the rock cycle (Figure 12.4 and Concept 12.1B). Rocks \nare recycled over millions of years by three processes\u2014\n \nerosion, melting, and metamorphism\u2014which produce sedi-\nmentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks, respectively.\nIn these processes, rocks are broken down, melted, \nfused together into new forms by heat and pressure, cooled, and sometimes recrystallized within the earth\u2019s interior and crust. The rock cycle is the slowest of the earth\u2019s cyclic pro-cesses and plays the major role in the formation of concen-trated deposits of nonrenewable mineral resources.\nWe Depend on a Variety of Nonrenewable \nMineral Resources\nWe know how to find and extract more than 100 different \nminerals from the earth\u2019s crust. They include metallic min-erals made of single elements, such as aluminum, gold, and the rare earths (Core Case Study), and those made of com-pounds such as rare earth oxides. Other mineral resources, including sand and limestone, are nonmetallic minerals made of nonmetallic elements and compounds. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the quantity of non-renewable minerals extracted globally increased threefold between 1995 and 2010.\nAn ore is rock that contains a large enough concentra-\ntion of a particular mineral\u2014often a metal\u2014to make it profitable for mining and processing. A high-grade ore  \ncontains a high concentration of the desired mineral, whereas a low-grade ore contains a lower concentration.\n90446_ch12_288-311.indd   292 8/13/14   11:01 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

We have never completely run out of a nonrenewable mineral resource, but a mineral becomes economically depleted when it costs more than it is worth to find, extract, transport, and pro-cess the remaining deposits (Concept 12.2A). At that point, there are five choices: recycle or reuse existing supplies, waste less, use less, find a substitute, or do without.\nDepletion time is the time it takes to use up a certain \nproportion\u2014usually 80%\u2014of the reserves of a mineral at a given rate of use. When experts disagree about depletion times, it is often because they are using different assump-tions about supplies and rates of use (Figure 12.5).\nThe shortest depletion-time estimate assumes no recy-\ncling or reuse and no increase in reserves (curve A, Figure 12.5). A longer depletion-time estimate assumes that recy-cling will stretch existing reserves and that better mining technology, higher prices, or new discoveries will increase reserves (curve B). The longest depletion-time estimate (curve C) makes the same assumptions as A and B, but also includes reuse and reduced consumption to further expand reserves. Finding a substitute for a resource leads to a new set of depletion curves for the new resource.\nThe earth\u2019s crust contains fairly abundant deposits of \nnonrenewable mineral resources such as iron and alumi-num. But concentrated deposits of important mineral re-sources such as manganese, chromium, cobalt, platinum, and some of the rare earths (see the following Case Study) are relatively scarce. Five nations\u2014the United States, Can-ada, Russia, South Africa, and Australia\u2014supply most of the nonrenewable mineral resources used by modern societies.\nSince 1900, and especially since 1950, there has been \na sharp rise in the total and per capita use of mineral re-sources in the United States. According to the USGS, each person in the United States uses an average of 22 metric tons (24 tons) of mineral resources per year. As a result, the United States has economically depleted some of its once-rich deposits of metals such as lead, aluminum, and iron. Currently, the United States imports all of its supplies of 20 key nonrenewable mineral resources and more than 90% of its supplies of 4 other key minerals. Most of these imports come from reliable and politically stable countries. But there are serious concerns about access to adequate supplies of four strategic metal resources\u2014manganese, cobalt, chromium, and platinum\u2014which are essential for the country\u2019s economic and military strength. The United States has little or no reserves of these metals.\nCASE STUDY\nGlobal and U.S. Rare Earth Supplies\nRare earth elements (Core Case Study) are not actually rare, for the most part, but they are hard to find in concen-trations high enough to extract and process at an afford-able price. According to the USGS, in 2010, China had roughly 50% of the world\u2019s known rare earth reserves, Russia had 15%, and the United States 13%.\nIn 2013, China produced about 80% of the world\u2019s \nrare earth metals and oxides. This is partly because China does not strictly regulate the environmentally disruptive mining and processing of rare earths. This means that Chi-nese companies have lower production costs than do com-panies in countries that regulate rare earth mining and processing more strictly.\nThe United States and Japan are heavily dependent on \nrare earths and their oxides. Japan has no rare earth reserves.

An increase in the price of a scarce mineral resource can often lead to increased supplies and can encourage more efficient use, but there are limits to this effect (Concept 12.2B).\nAccording to standard economic theory, in a competi-\ntive market system when a resource becomes scarce, its price rises. This can encourage exploration for new depos-its, stimulate development of better mining technology, and make it profitable to mine lower-grade ores. It can also encourage a search for substitutes and promote resource conservation.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Metal Prices and Thievery\nResource scarcity can also promote thievery. For example, because of increas-\ning demand, copper prices have risen sharply in recent years. As a result, in several U.S. communities, people have been stealing copper to sell it\u2014strip-ping abandoned houses of copper pipe and wiring and stealing outdoor cen-tral air conditioning units for their copper coils. They have also stolen electrical wiring from beneath city streets and copper piping from farm irrigation sys-tems. In one Oklahoma town, someone cut down several utility poles and stole the copper electrical wiring, causing a blackout.\nAccording to some economists, this price effect may no \nlonger apply very well in most of the more-developed \ncountries. Governments in such countries often use subsi-dies, tax breaks, and import tariffs to control the supply, demand, and prices of key mineral resources to such an extent that a truly competitive free market does not exist. In the United States, for instance, mining companies get various types of government subsidies, including depletion allowances\u2014permission to deduct from their taxable in-comes the costs of developing and extracting mineral re-sources. These allowances amount to 5\u201322% of their gross income gained from selling the mineral resources.\nMining company representatives insist that they need \ntaxpayer subsidies and tax breaks to keep the prices of minerals low for consumers. They also claim that, without these subsidies and tax breaks, their companies might move their operations to other countries where they would not have to pay taxes or comply with strict mining and pollution control regulations.\nCan We Expand Reserves by Mining \nLower-Grade Ores?\nSome analysts contend that we can increase supplies of \nsome minerals by extracting them from lower-grade ores. They point to the development of new earth-moving equipment, improved techniques for removing impurities from ores, and other technological advances in mineral extraction and processing that can make lower-grade ores accessible, sometimes at lower costs. For example, in 1900, the copper ore mined in the United States was typically about 5% copper by weight. Today, it is typically about 0.5%, yet copper costs less (when prices are adjusted for inflation).\nHowever, several factors can limit the mining of lower-\ngrade ores (Concept 12.2B). For one, it requires mining and processing larger volumes of ore, which takes much more energy and costs more. Another factor is the dwin-dling supplies of freshwater needed for the mining and processing of some minerals, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. A third limiting factor is the growing environ-mental impacts of land disruption, along with waste material and pollution produced during mining and pro-cessing. We discuss this further in the next section of this chapter.\nOne way to improve mining technology and reduce its \nenvironmental impact is to use a biological approach, sometimes called biomining. Miners use natural or geneti-cally engineered bacteria to remove desired metals from ores through wells bored into the deposits.

This leaves the surrounding environment undisturbed and reduces the air and water pollution associated with removing the metal from metal ores. On the down side, biomining is slow. It can take decades to remove the same amount of material that conventional methods can remove within months or years. So far, biomining methods are economically feasible only for low-grade ores for which conventional techniques are too expensive.\nCan We Get More Minerals  \nfrom the Oceans?\nMost of the chemical elements and compounds found in \nseawater occur in such low concentrations that recovering these mineral resources takes more energy and money than they are worth. Currently, only magnesium, bro-mine, and sodium chloride are abundant enough to be extracted profitably from seawater. On the other hand, in sediments along the shallow continental shelf and adja-cent shorelines, there are significant deposits of minerals such as sand, gravel, phosphates, copper, iron, tungsten, silver, titanium, platinum, and diamonds.\nAnother potential ocean source of some minerals is \nhydrothermal ore deposits that form when superheated, mineral-rich water shoots out of vents in volcanic regions of the ocean floor. As the hot water comes into contact with cold seawater, black particles of various metal sulfides precipitate out and accumulate as chimney-like structures, called black smokers, near the hot water vents (Figure 12.6). \nThese deposits are especially rich in minerals such as cop-per, lead, zinc, silver, gold, and some of the rare earth met-als.

In 2011, China began using remote-controlled underwater equipment and a manned deep-sea craft to evaluate the mining of mineral deposits around black smokers in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar as well as in other deep-sea areas. Also in that year, Japanese explorers found large deposits of rare-earth minerals (Core Case Study) on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. The UN International Seabed Authority, established to manage seafloor mining in inter -\nnational waters, began issuing mining permits in 2011.\nSome analysts say that seafloor mining is less environ-\nmentally harmful than mining on land. However, marine biologists are concerned that the sediment stirred up by such mining could harm or kill organisms that feed by filtering seawater. Proponents of the mining say that the number of potential mining sites is quite small and that many of these organisms can live elsewhere.\nAnother possible source of metals from the ocean is the \npotato-size manganese nodules that cover large areas of the \nPacific Ocean floor and smaller areas of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean floors. They also contain some low concen-trations of various rare earth minerals (Core Case Study). These modules could be sucked up by giant vacuum pipes or scooped up by underwater mining machines.\nSo far, mining on the ocean floor has been hindered by \nthe high costs involved, the potential threat to marine ecosystems, and arguments over rights to the minerals in deep ocean areas that belong to no one country.\n12.3 WHAT ARE THE \nENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS  OF USING NONRENEWABLE MINERAL RESOURCES?\nCONCEPT 12.3   Extracting minerals from the earth\u2019s crust \nand converting them to useful products can disturb the \nland, erode soils, produce large amounts of solid waste, and pollute the air, water, and soil.\nRemoval and Use of Mineral Deposits Have \nHarmful Environmental Effects\nEvery metal product has a life cycle that includes mining \nthe mineral, processing it, manufacturing the product, and disposal or recycling of the product (Figure 12.7).

The more accessible higher-grade ores are usually exploited first. Mining lower-grade ores takes more money, energy, water, and other resources, and leads to more land disruption, mining waste, and pollution.\nSeveral different mining techniques are used to remove \nmineral deposits. Shallow mineral deposits are removed by surface mining, in which vegetation, soil, and \nrock overlying a mineral deposit are cleared away. The soil and rock, called overburden, are usually deposited in piles of waste material called spoils (Figure 12.8). Surface mining is used to extract about 90% of the nonfuel mineral resources and 60% of the coal used in the United States.\nDifferent types of surface mining can be used, \ndepending on two factors: the resource being sought and the local topography. In open-pit \nmining, machines are used to dig very large holes and remove metal ores containing copper (see chapter-opening photo), gold (see Case Study that follows), or other metals, or sand, gravel, or stone.\nStrip mining is any form of mining involving \nthe extraction of mineral deposits that lie in large horizon-tal beds close to the earth\u2019s surface. In area strip mining, used where the terrain is fairly flat, a gigantic earthmover strips away the overburden, and a power shovel\u2014which can be as tall as a 20-story building\u2014removes the mineral deposit or an energy resource such as coal (Figure 12.9). The resulting trench is filled with overburden, and a new cut is made parallel to the previous one. This process is repeated over the entire site.\n\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\n90446_ch12_288-311.indd   297 8/13/14   11:02 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Unless the land is restored, what is left are a series of spoils banks and a highly erodible bank of soil and rock called a highwall.\nAnother surface mining method is mountaintop re-\nmoval, in which the top of a mountain is removed to expose seams of coal, which are then extracted (Figure 12.11). This method is commonly used in the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. With this method, after a mountaintop is blown apart, enormous machines plow waste rock and dirt into valleys below the mountaintops. This destroys forests, buries mountain streams, and in-creases the risk of flooding. Wastewater and toxic sludge, produced when the coal is processed, are often stored be-hind dams in these valleys, which can overflow or collapse and release toxic substances such as arsenic and mercury.\nIn the United States, more than 500 mountaintops in \nWest Virginia and other Appalachian states have been re-moved to extract coal. According to the U.S. Environmen-tal Protection Agency (EPA), the resulting spoils have buried more than 1,100 kilometers (700 miles) of streams\u2014a total roughly equal in length to the distance between the two U.S. cities of New York and Chicago.The U.S. Department of the Interior estimates that at \nleast 500,000 surface-mined sites dot the U.S. landscape, mostly in the West. Such sites can be cleaned up and re-stored, but it is costly and is rarely done even when re-quired by law.\nDeep deposits of minerals are removed by subsurface \nmining, in which underground mineral resources are re-moved through tunnels and shafts. This method is used to remove metal ores and coal that are too deep to be ex-tracted by surface mining. Miners dig a deep, vertical shaft, blast open subsurface tunnels and chambers to reach the deposit, and use machinery to remove the resource and transport it to the surface.\nSubsurface mining disturbs less than one-tenth as \nmuch land as surface mining disturbs, and it usually pro-duces less waste material. However, it creates hazards such as cave-ins, explosions, and fires for miners. Miners often get lung diseases caused by prolonged inhalation of min-eral or coal dust in subsurface mines. Another problem is subsidence\u2014the collapse of land above some underground mines. It can damage houses, crack sewer lines, break gas mains, and disrupt groundwater systems.Several hundred mountaintops have \nbeen blown apart to mine coal in the United States.\nFIGURE 12.11   Natural capital degradation: Mountaintop removal coal mining near Whitesville, \nWest Virginia.\nJim West/Age FotostockSeveral hundred \nmountaintops have \nbeen blown apart \nto mine coal in the \nUnited States.\n90446_ch12_288-311.indd   298 8/13/14   11:02 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

For example, acid mine drainage occurs when rainwater that \nseeps through an underground mine or a spoils pile from a surface mine carries sulfuric acid (H\n2SO4, produced \nwhen aerobic bacteria act on minerals in the spoils) to nearby streams and groundwater.\nAccording to the EPA, mining has polluted mountain \nstreams in about 40% of the western watersheds in the United States, and it accounts for 50% of all the country\u2019s emissions of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. In fact, the mining industry produces more of such toxic emis-sions than any other U.S. industry.\nWhere environmental regulations and enforcement \nhave not been strict, the mining and processing of rare earths (Core Case Study) has had a very harmful environ-mental impact. For example, in China, the extraction and processing of rare earth metals and oxides has stripped much land of its vegetation and topsoil while polluting the air, acidifying streams, and leaving toxic and radioactive waste piles.CASE STUDY\nThe Real Cost of Gold\nMany newlyweds would be surprised to know that mining enough gold to make their wedding rings produced roughly enough mining waste to equal the total weight of more than three mid-size cars. This waste is usually left piled near the mine site and can pollute the air and nearby surface water.\nIn 2012, the world\u2019s top five gold-producing countries \nwere, in order, China, Australia, the United States, South Africa, and Russia. Many mining companies dig up mas-sive amounts of rock (Figure 12.12) containing only small concentrations of gold. At about 90% of the world\u2019s gold mines, the mineral is extracted with the use of a solution of highly toxic cyanide salts sprayed onto piles of crushed rock. The solution reacts with the gold and then drains off the rocks, pulling some gold with it, into settling ponds. After the solution is recirculated a number of times, the gold is removed from the ponds.\nUntil sunlight breaks down the cyanide, it is extremely \ntoxic to birds and mammals drawn to these ponds in search of water. The ponds can also leak or overflow, which poses \nFIGURE 12.12   Gold mine in New Zealand.Jiri Foltyn/Shutterstock\n90446_ch12_288-311.indd   299 8/13/14   11:02 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Ultrathin graphene con-sists of a single layer of carbon atoms packed into a two-dimensional hexago-nal lattice (somewhat like chicken wire) that can be applied as a transparent film to surfaces (Figure 12.\na).\nGraphene is one of the world\u2019s thin-\nnest and strongest materials and is light, flexible, and stretchable. \na single \nlayer of graphene is 150,000 times thinner than a human hair and 200 times stronger than structural steel. \na \nsheet of this amazing material stretched over a coffee mug could support the weight of a car. It is also a good con-ductor of electricity and conducts heat better than any known material.\nThe use of graphene could revolu-\ntionize the electric car industry by lead-ing to the production of batteries that can be recharged 10 times faster and hold 10 times more power than cur -\nrent car batteries. Graphene compos-ites can also be used to make stronger and lighter plastics, lightweight aircraft and motor vehicles, flexible computer tablets, and TV screens as thin as a magazine. Within 5 years, it might also be used to make flexible, more effi-cient, less costly solar cells that can be attached to almost anything. Graphene could also replace the silicon transistors that are used as chips in computers and other electronic devices, and this could make almost any electronic de-vice run much faster and use less power. Indeed, some scientists contend that the use of graphene will change the world more than any technological development since the invention of the silicon chip.\nGraphene is made from very high \npurity and expensive graphite. \naccord-\ning to the USGS, China controls about 73% of the world\u2019s high-purity graph-ite production. \nas with rare earth met-\nals (Core Case Study), the United States mines very little natural graphite and imports most of its graphite from China, which may restrict U.S. product exports as the use of graphene grows.\nGeologists are looking for deposits \nof graphite in the United", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3724, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "619acde9-7e57-4fd3-bf2a-19c037c3668a": {"__data__": {"id_": "619acde9-7e57-4fd3-bf2a-19c037c3668a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "G.

One way to increase supplies is to extract and re-cycle rare earth metals from the massive amounts of elec-tronic wastes that are being produced.

The problem is that some countries, in-cluding the United States, do not have large supplies of lithium.

Bolivia alone has about 50% of these reserves, while the United States holds only about 3%.\nAs a result of this, Japan, China, South Korea, and the \nUnited Arab Emirates are buying up access to global lith-ium reserves to ensure their ability to sell lithium or bat-teries to the rest of the world.

However, according to geologists, the flows of energy and heated material within the earth\u2019s convection cells (Figure 12.3) are so powerful that they have caused the lithosphere to break up into a dozen or so huge rigid plates, called tectonic plates, which move extremely slowly atop the asthenosphere (Figure 12.14).\nThese gigantic plates are somewhat like the world\u2019s \nlargest and slowest-moving surfboards on which we ride without noticing their movement. Their typical speed is about the rate at which your fingernails grow. Throughout the earth\u2019s history, continents have split apart and joined as tectonic plates shifted around atop the earth\u2019s astheno-sphere (Figure 4.D, p. 76).\nMuch of the geological activity at the earth\u2019s surface \ntakes place at the boundaries between tectonic plates as they separate, collide, or grind along against each other (Figure 12.15). The tremendous forces produced at these plate boundaries can cause mountains or deep rifts to form, earthquakes to shake parts of the crust, and volca-noes to erupt.\nVolcanoes Release Molten Rock from the \nEarth\u2019s Interior\nAn active volcano occurs where magma rising in a plume \nthrough the lithosphere reaches the earth\u2019s surface through a central vent or a long crack, called a fissure (Figure 12.16). Magma that reaches the earth\u2019s surface is called lava and often builds into a cone.\nANIMATED FIGURE 12.14   The earth\u2019s crust has been fractured into several major tectonic plates. \nQuestion: Which plate are you riding on?\nNorth American plate Juan\nDe Fuca\nplate\nSouth\nAmerican\nplateAfrican plateArabian\nplatePhilippineplateEurasian plate\nIndian-Australian\nplateCocos plateCaribbeanplate\nScotia plateAntarctic platePaci/f_ic platePaci/f_ic plate\nNazca plate\n\u00a91990 Tom Van Sant, Inc./The GeoSphere Project\nSanta Monica, California\n\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\n90446_ch12_288-311.indd   304 8/13/14   11:02 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Volcanoes can erupt, re-leasing large chunks of lava rock, glowing hot ash, liquid lava, and gases (including water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide) into the environment (Concept 12.5). Eruptions can be extremely destructive, causing loss of life and obliterating ecosystems and human communities.\nWhile volcanic eruptions can be destructive, they do \nprovide some benefits. They can result in the formation of majestic mountains and lakes and the weathering of lava contributes to fertile soils. Hundreds of volcanoes have erupted on the ocean floor, building cones that have reached the ocean\u2019s surface, eventually to form islands that have become suitable for human settlement.\nWe can reduce the loss of human life and some of the \nproperty damage caused by volcanic eruptions by using historical records and geological measurements to identify high-risk areas, so that people can avoid living in those areas. We also use monitoring devices that warn us when volcanoes are likely to erupt, and in some areas that are prone to volcanic activity, evacuation plans have been developed.\nEarthquakes Are Geological  \nRock-and-Roll Events\nForces inside the earth\u2019s mantle put tremendous stress on \nrock within the crust. Such stresses can be great enough to cause sudden breakage and shifting of the rock, producing a fault, or fracture in the earth\u2019s crust (Figure 12.15). \nWhen a fault forms, or when there is abrupt movement on an existing fault, energy that has accumulated over time is released in the form of vibrations, called seismic waves, that move in all directions through the surrounding rock\u2014an event called an earthquake (Figure 12.17 and Concept 12.5). Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries of tec-tonic plates.\nSeismic waves move upward and outward from the \nearthquake\u2019s focus like ripples in a pool of water. Scientists \nmeasure the severity of an earthquake by the magnitude of its seismic waves. The magnitude is a measure of ground motion (shaking) caused by the earthquake, as indicated by the amplitude, or size of the seismic waves when they reach a recording instrument, called a seismograph.\nScientists use the Richter scale, on which each unit has \nan amplitude 10 times greater than the next smaller unit. Seismologists rate earthquakes as insignificant (less than 4.0 on the Richter scale), minor (4.0\u20134.9), damaging (5.0\u20135.9), destructive (6.0\u20136.9), major (7.0\u20137.9), and great (over \n8.0). The largest recorded earthquake occurred in Chile on May 22, 1960, and measured 9.5 on the Richter scale. Each year, scientists record the magnitudes of more than 1 million earthquakes, most of which are too small to feel.\nThe primary effects of earthquakes include shaking \nand sometimes a permanent vertical or horizontal dis-placement of a part of the crust. These effects can have serious consequences for people and for buildings, bridges, freeway overpasses, dams, and pipelines. A major earth-quake is a very large rock-and-roll geological event.\nOne way to reduce the loss of life and property damage \nfrom earthquakes is to examine historical records and make geological measurements to locate active fault zones.

It also heavily damaged three nuclear reactors, which then released dangerous radioactivity into the surround-ing environment.\nIn some areas, scientists have built networks of ocean \nbuoys and pressure recorders on the ocean floor to collect data that can be relayed to tsunami emergency warning centers. However, these networks are far from complete.\n90446_ch12_288-311.indd   309 8/13/14   4:06 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Do you think there are any types of supporting scientific data not mentioned in the article that would strengthen the author\u2019s conclusions? For example, would you add statistical data to support a point, or data in a graph indicating possible cause-and-effect relationships? Be specific and give reasons for your suggestions.\nData Analysis\nRare earth metals are widely used in a variety of impor -\ntant products (Core Case Study). According to the U.S. Geological Survey, China has about 50% of the world\u2019s reserves of rare earth metals. Use this information to an-swer the following questions.\n 1. In 2010, China had 55 million metric tons of rare earth metals in its reserves and produced 130,000 metric tons of these metals. At this rate of production how long will China\u2019s rare earth reserves last? 2. In 2010, the global demand for rare earth metals was about 133,600 metric tons. At this annual rate of use, if China were to produce all of the world\u2019s rare earth metals, how long would their reserves last?\n 3. The annual global demand for rare earth metals is projected to rise to at least 185,000 metric tons by 2015. At this rate, if China were to produce all of the world\u2019s rare earth metals, how long would its re-serves last?\n To access course materials, including Aplia homework, please visit www.cengagebrain.com.\n90446_ch12_288-311.indd   311 8/13/14   11:02 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This results in more solar energy at the equator and less at the poles. Together with the earth\u2019s rotation, these differ -\nences create flows of air called wind  \n(see Figure 7.3, p. 132). Because wind is an indirect form of solar energy, relying more on wind is one way to apply the solar energy principle  \nof sustainability.\nWe can capture this energy with \ngroups of wind turbines called wind farms that convert wind energy to electrical energy (Figure 13.1, left)  \nthat can be fed into electrical grids. We can locate wind farms on land  \nor at sea (Figure 13.1, right).\nBecause today\u2019s wind turbine tow-\ners can be as tall as a 30-story building and typically have blades as long as 60 meters (200 feet) (see chapter-opening photo), they can tap into the stronger and more reliable winds found at higher altitudes on land and at sea. This allows them to produce more electricity at a lower cost. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that wind farms at favorable sites in just three U.S. states\u2014North Dakota, Kansas, and Texas\u2014could more than meet the electricity needs of the lower 48 states. In addition, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that offshore winds\u2014off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and off the shores of the Great Lakes\u2014could gen-erate four times the electricity cur -\nrently used in the lower 48 states.\nTexas, the nation\u2019s leading oil-\nproducing state, is also the nation\u2019s leading producer of electricity from wind power, followed by California. These two states produce more elec-tricity from wind than all but five of the world\u2019s countries. To some ana-lysts, wind power has more advan-tages and fewer serious disadvantages than all other energy resources except for energy efficiency, another topic covered in this chapter.Wind power proponents call for a \ncrash program to develop land-based and offshore wind farms in the United States and to build an updated and expanded smart electrical grid to transmit the electricity they produce to consumers. Over time, this would help reduce the country\u2019s dependence on coal, which, when burned to produce electricity, emits air pollutants that kill at least 24,000 Americans a year and adds huge quantities of climate-changing CO\n2 to the atmosphere. \nGreatly expanding the U.S. wind tur -\nbine industry would also create many thousands of new jobs and boost the American economy.\nIn this chapter, we explore and \ncompare the benefits and drawbacks of the key energy resources on which we now depend, including nonrenewable resources such as oil, coal, and nuclear power, and renewable resources such as wind, solar energy, flowing water, and the earth\u2019s internal heat.The Astounding Potential for Wind Power in the United States\n314 Left: \u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning; Right: ssuaphotos/Shutterstock.com\nFIGURE 13.1   Wind turbines \nconvert the kinetic energy in \nwind to electricity, another form of kinetic energy (moving elec-trons).

For example, before oil \nbecomes useful to us, it must be found, pumped up from beneath the ground or ocean floor, transferred to a refin-ery, converted to gasoline and other fuels and chemicals, and delivered to consumers. Each of these steps uses high-quality energy, obtained mostly by burning fossil fuels, especially gasoline and diesel fuel.\nThe usable amount of high-quality energy available \nfrom an energy resource is its net energy yield. It is the total amount of high-quality energy available from a given quantity of an energy resource minus the high-quality en-ergy needed to make the energy available (Concept 13.1). Suppose that it takes about 9 units of high-quality energy to produce 10 units of high-quality energy from an energy resource. Then the net energy yield is 1 unit of energy.\nNet energy is like the net profit earned by a business \nafter it deducts its expenses. If a business has $1 million in sales and $900,000 in expenses, its net profit is $100,000.\nFigure 13.2 shows generalized net energy yields for \nenergy resources and systems that generate electricity, heat homes and other buildings, produce high-temperature heat for industrial processes, and provide transportation. It is based on several sources of scientific data and classifies estimated net energy yields as high, medium, low, or nega-tive (negative being a net energy loss). Many analysts view net energy yield as the single most important measure that we can use to evaluate the long-term economic usefulness of different energy resources.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Energy Resources and the Laws of \nThermodynamics\nNet energy yields are based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics \n(see pp. 34\u201336)\u2014two scientific laws that we cannot violate no matter how clever we are. Technology can help us exploit an energy resource more cheaply, cleanly, and efficiently, but because of the first law we cannot create energy. And because of the second law, whenever we use any type of high-quality en-ergy, it is always degraded into lower-quality energy, mostly heat that ends up in the environment. This means that we cannot recycle high-quality energy.\nEnergy ef/f_iciency\nPassive solar\nNatural gas\nGeothermal energy\nOil\nActive solar\nHeavy shale oil\nHeavy oil from tar sands\nElectricity\nHydrogenSpace HeatingElectricity\nEnergy ef/f_iciency\nHydropower\nWind\nCoal\nNatural gas\nGeothermal energy\nSolar cells\nNuclear fuel cycle\nHydrogen\nHigh\nMediumMediumMediumMediumLow to mediumLowLowLowNegative (Energy loss)Net Energy Yield\nEnergy ef/f_iciency (cogeneration)\nCoal\nNatural gas\nOil\nHeavy shale oil\nHeavy oil from tar sands\nDirect solar (concentrated)\nHydrogenHigh-Temperature Industrial Heat\nTransportation\nEnergy ef/f_iciency\nGasoline\nNatural gas\nEthanol (from sugarcane)\nDiesel\nGasoline from heavy shale oil\nGasoline from heavy tar sand oil\nEthanol (from corn)\nBiodiesel (from soy)\nHydrogenHigh HighMediumMediumLowLowLow Negative (Energy loss)\nHigh\nHighMediumMediumMediumLowLowLowLowNegative (Energy loss)Net Energy Yield\nNet Energy Yield Net Energy YieldHigh\nHighHighHigh MediumMediumLow to mediumLowNegative (Energy loss)\nFIGURE 13.2   Generalized net energy yields for various energy resources and systems (Concept 13.1). \nQuestion: Based only on these data, which two resources in each category should we be using?\nCompiled by the authors using data from the U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Agriculture; Colorado Energy Research Institute, Net \n Energy", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3806, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87f2cadf-6153-40c9-936e-49c2528f8370": {"__data__": {"id_": "87f2cadf-6153-40c9-936e-49c2528f8370", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "315", "file_name": "G.

The low net energy yield for the whole fuel cycle is one reason why governments (taxpayers) throughout the world must heavily subsidize nuclear-generated electricity to make it available to consumers at an affordable price.\n13.2 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES \nAND DISADVANTAGES OF USING FOSSIL FUELS?\nCONCEPT 13.2   Oil, natural gas, and coal are currently \nabundant and relatively inexpensive, but using them  \ncauses air and water pollution, degrades large areas of \nland, and releases climate-changing greenhouse gases  \nto the atmosphere.Fossil Fuels Supply Most of Our \nCommercial Energy\nThe energy that heats the earth and makes it livable for us \ncomes from the sun at no cost to us\u2014in keeping with the solar energy principle of sustainability. Without this essentially inexhaustible input of solar en-ergy, the earth\u2019s average temperature would be \u2212240 \u00b0C (\u2212400 \u00b0F) and life as we know it would not exist.\nThis direct input of solar energy produces several other \nforms of renewable energy resources that can be thought of as indirect solar energy: wind (moving air masses heated by the sun, see Core Case Study), flowing water (made pos-\nsible by solar energy, which evaporates water that returns to the earth as precipitation and flows in rivers), and bio-mass (solar energy converted to chemical energy and stored in the tissues of trees and other plants that can be burned as a source of energy).\nIn 2012, the world\u2019s three largest users of commercial \nenergy\u2014energy sold in the marketplace\u2014were China (22% of the global total), the United States (18%), and Russia (6%). Most of this energy comes from extracting and burning nonrenewable energy resources obtained from the \nearth\u2019s crust. About 91% of the world\u2019s commercial energy comes from nonrenewable resources\u201487% from carbon-containing fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) and 4% from nuclear power (Figure 13.3, left). The remaining 9% of the commercial energy we use comes from renewable energy resources such as biomass, hydropower, geothermal, wind, and solar energy. (In Supplement 5, see Figure 1,  \np. S39, showing total and per capita U.S. energy use from 1950 to 2012; and Figure 2, p.

It is also known as conventional or light crude oil. It was formed from the de-cayed remains of ancient organisms that were crushed beneath layers of rock for millions of years.\nDeposits of conventional crude oil and natural gas often \nare trapped together beneath layers of impermeable rock within the earth\u2019s crust on land or under the seafloor. The crude oil is dispersed in pores and cracks in underground rock formations, somewhat like water saturating a sponge.\nGeologists identify potential oil deposits by using large \nmachines to pound the earth, sending shock waves deep underground, and they measure how long it takes for the waves to be reflected back. This information is fed into computers and converted into 3-D seismic maps of the un-derground that show the locations and sizes of various rock formations. In 2014, scientists were evaluating a new technology in which a fast-moving plane at a high altitude seeks to detect changes in the gravitational field deep  \nunderground to pinpoint perspective oil and natural gas deposits.When oil is found, oil companies drill holes and re-\nmove rock cores from potential oil deposit areas to learn whether there is enough oil to be extracted profitably. If there is, one or more wells are drilled and the oil, drawn by gravity out of the rock pores, flows to the bottom of the well and is pumped from there to the surface.\nAfter years of pumping, usually a decade or so, the \npressure in a well drops and its rate of conventional crude oil production starts to decline. This point in time is re-ferred to as peak production for the well. The same thing can happen to a large oil field when the overall rate of production from its numerous wells begins to decline.\nGlobal peak production occurs when the rate of global \nproduction of crude oil begins to decline faster than new oil fields are found and put into production. There is dis-agreement among experts about whether we have reached this point and when we might reach it if we have not. When this happens we can expect net energy yields from crude oil to decline and oil prices to rise as the largest, cheapest, and most accessible oil fields with high net en-ergy yields become depleted. At global peak production, we will start to use the latter half of the world\u2019s estimated crude oil reserves.\nCrude oil from a well cannot be used as it is. It is trans-\nported to a refinery by pipeline, truck, rail, or ship (oil tanker) where it is heated to separate it into various fuels and other components with different boiling points (Fig-ure 13.4) in a complex process called refining. This pro-cess, like all other steps in the cycle of oil production and use, requires an input of high-quality energy and de-creases the net energy yield of oil.\nOil refining also produces large quantities of petroleum \ncoke or petcoke, a black powder that often accumulates in huge piles. Winds can blow harmful fine particles from these piles into the atmosphere, unless they are covered or the powder is stored safely to prevent such pollution. About 2% of the products of refining, called petrochemicals, are \nused as raw materials to make industrial organic chemicals, cleaning fluids, pesticides, plastics, synthetic fibers, paints, medicines, cosmetics, and many other products.\nGasesLowest Boiling Point\nHighest Boiling PointGasoline\nAviation\nfuel\nHeating oil\nDiesel\noil\nHeatedcrude oil\nFurnaceNaphtha\nGrease\nand wax\nAsphaltFIGURE 13.4   When crude oil is refined, many of its components are", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3751, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d59efdb1-fc8c-4c23-b257-ad47187a5c13": {"__data__": {"id_": "d59efdb1-fc8c-4c23-b257-ad47187a5c13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "317", "file_name": "G.

Laid end to end, the roughly 32 billion barrels of crude oil used worldwide in 2012 would stretch to about 28 million kilometers (18 million miles)\u2014far enough to reach to the moon and back about 37 times. (One barrel of oil contains 159 liters or 42 gallons of oil.)How much crude oil is there? No one knows, although \ngeologists have estimated the amounts existing in identi-fied oil deposits. Available deposits are called proven oil reserves\u2014deposits from which the oil can be extracted profitably at current prices using current technology. Proven oil reserves are not fixed. For example, a combina-tion of oil extraction technologies (Science Focus 13.1) and high oil prices have made it profitable to extract light \nGeologists have known for decades \nabout vast deposits of oil and natural \ngas that are widely dispersed and trapped between compressed layers \n   \nof shale rock formations found deep underground in many areas of the United States, including North Dakota, Texas, and Pennsylvania.\nUntil recently, it cost too much to \nextract such oil (called tight oil) and natural gas from shale rock. This situa-tion has changed because of high oil prices along with the growing use of two extraction technologies (Figure 13.A). One is horizontal drilling, a method that involves drilling first verti-cally to a certain point, then turning the flexible shaft of the drill and drilling horizontally to gain access to the tightly held oil and natural gas deposits.\nThe second technology, called \n hydraulic fracturing or fracking,  is then used to free this trapped oil and natural gas. In a fracking opera-tion, high-pressure pumps blast a huge volume of a slimy mixture of water, sand, and various chemicals into a well to fracture the porous rock and create cracks. The sand becomes wedged in the cracks and keeps them open to al-low the oil or natural gas and about half the water-chemical mixture to flow out and be pumped to the surface. This hazardous slurry contains a mix  \nof naturally occurring salts, toxic heavy metals, and radioactive materials FIGURE 13.A   hori-\nzontal drilling and hy-\ndraulic fracturing, or fracking, are being used to release large amounts of oil and natural gas that are tightly held in shale rock formations.\n\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\nenergy yield, compared to conventional \noil and natural gas production, which means that market prices of oil and natural gas must remain high enough to make it profitable to produce oil and natural gas from these deposits.\nCritical Thinking\nWhy do you think horizontal drilling \n allows better access to tightly held oil and natural gas deposits than does drilling vertically into such deposits?REMOVING TIGHTLY HELD OIL AND \nNATURAL GAS BY DRILLING SIDEWAYS AND FRACKING\nleached from the \nrock, along with some potentially harmful drilling chemicals that \n natural gas com -\npanies are not re-quired to identify or publicize.

They drill a well, frack it several times, and then drill a new well and repeat the process.

We can also rely more on unconventional heavy oil\u2014a thick type of crude oil that does not flow as easily as light oil\u2014from depleted oil wells and other sources. But the use of these sources of oil results in lower net energy yields, higher environmental impacts, higher production costs, and probably higher oil prices.\nThe 12 countries that make up the Organization of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have about 72% of the world\u2019s proven crude oil reserves and thus are likely to control most of the world\u2019s conventional oil supplies for many years to come.

Most oil geologists say this is highly unlikely.\nCASE STUDY\nOil Production and Consumption in the \nUnited States\nThe United States gets about 87% of its commercial energy \nfrom fossil fuels, with 33% coming from crude oil (Figure 13.3, right). Currently, oil production in the United States, especially from shale rock deposits, is growing enough to make the United States the world\u2019s top producer of crude oil by 2017, according to a 2013 report by the Interna-tional Energy Agency. (See Figure 15, p. S32, in Supple-ment 4 for a map of most of North America\u2019s proven and potential fossil fuel reserves; and Figure 2, p. S39, in Supplement 5 for a graph of U.S. oil consumption between 1980 and 2012, with projections to 2040.)\nSince 1982, oil consumption in the United States has \ngreatly exceeded domestic production and thus the country has had to import some of the oil it uses. This gap has been narrowed by rising domestic production of tight oil. The United States imported about 40% of its crude oil in 2012, compared to 60% in 2005. According to the DOE, the United States spent an average of about $824,000 per minute on imported oil in 2012. The four largest suppliers of imported oil for the United States in 2012 were Canada (34%), Saudi Arabia (18%), Venezuela (12%), and Russia (10%).\nCan the United States significantly reduce its depen-\ndence on oil imports by producing its own oil faster than its current oil supply is being depleted?

Before the thick shale oil is pumped through a pressurized pipeline to a refinery, it must be heated to increase its flow rate and processed to remove sulfur, nitrogen, and other impurities.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Shale Oil Production\nHow do you think the process described here affects the net energy yield of \nshale oil? explain.About 72% of the world\u2019s estimated oil shale rock re-\nserves are buried deep in rock formations located primarily \nunder government-owned land in the U.S. states of Colo-rado, Wyoming, and Utah. However, the net energy yield for this energy resource is low (Figure 13.2) and the pro-cess has a large and harmful environmental impact. In 2011, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management stated that unless oil prices rise sharply, \u201cthere are no economically viable ways yet known to extract and process oil shale for commercial purposes.\u201d\nA growing source of heavy oil is tar sands, or oil \nsands, which are a mixture of clay, sand, water, and a combustible organic material called bitumen\u2014a thick, sticky, tar-like heavy oil with a high sulfur content. North-eastern Alberta in Canada has three-fourths of the world\u2019s tar sands resource in sandy soil under a vast area of remote boreal forest. If we include its conventional light oil and its heavy oil from tar sands, Canada has the world\u2019s third largest proven oil reserves.\nThe two big drawbacks to producing oil from tar sands \nare its low net energy yield (Figure 13.2) and its major harmful impacts on the land (Figure 13.7), air, water, wildlife, and climate. According to a 2014 Canadian gov-ernment report, the largest producer of Canada\u2019s green-house gases is its energy sector, with over 70% of the emissions coming from its tar sands industry. And the volume of tar sands mining is expected to nearly double by 2021. Figure 13.8 lists the major advantages and disadvan-tages of producing heavy oil from oil shale rock and tar sands.\nSince 2005, there has been a controversy over building \nthe Keystone XL pipeline, which would allow Canada to send its heavy crude oil (bitumen) through the United States to Gulf Coast refineries. Keystone proponents argue that it would create thousands of jobs while adding to oil supplies, but opponents say it would result in less than 100 permanent jobs, once the pipeline is built. Opponents also contend that the pipeline will promote the development of the world\u2019s most environmentally harmful form of oil pro-duction, and that it would be built over a part of the Ogal-lala Aquifer (see p. 256), on which millions of Americans depend for irrigation and drinking water. Furthermore, they say, it would not boost U.S. oil reserves because most of the resulting oil would be sold overseas.\nProponents argue that if this pipeline is not built, \nCanada could build a pipeline to the refineries on its west coast and then, after refining it, ship most of its heavy oil to China. It might also ship much of its heavy oil to other refineries by truck and rail, which pipeline proponents say, would add to the risks of oil spills and higher greenhouse gas emissions. In response, opponents say that just one spill from the pipeline could permanently damage some part of the irreplaceable Ogallala Aquifer.\nIn 2014, this controversy was mounting, with heavy \npressure being applied by both sides to decision makers in the U.S. government.\nConventional Oil\nWater pollution from \noil spills and leaks\nEnvironmental costs \nnot included in market price\nReleases CO\n2 and \nother air", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3736, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6e7470b-024f-492b-b7fa-c2235454eefb": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6e7470b-024f-492b-b7fa-c2235454eefb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "320", "file_name": "G.

It can also be used as a fuel for cars and trucks and for natural gas turbines used to pro-duce electricity in power plants.\nThis versatility helps to explain why natural gas pro-\nvided about 28% of the energy (Figure 13.3, right) and 27% of the electricity consumed in the United States in 2013 (up from 17% in 2003). It burns cleaner than oil and much cleaner than coal, and when burned completely, it emits about 30% less CO\n2 than oil and about 50% less than coal.\nConventional natural gas is often found in deposits ly-\ning above deposits of conventional oil. It also exists in tightly held deposits between layers of shale rock and can be extracted through horizontal drilling and fracking (Sci-ence Focus 13.1). (See Figure 17, p. S34, in Supplement 4 for a map of U.S. natural gas shale rock deposits.)\nWhen a natural gas deposit is tapped, propane and \nbutane gases can be liquefied under high pressure and removed as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). LPG is stored in pressurized tanks for use mostly in rural areas not served by natural gas pipelines. The rest of the gas (mostly methane) is purified and pumped into pressurized pipelines for distribution across land areas.\nNatural gas can also be transported across oceans, by \nconverting it to liquefied natural gas (LNG) at a high pressure and at a very low temperature. This highly flam-mable liquid is transported in refrigerated tanker ships. At its destination port, it is heated and converted back to the gaseous state and then distributed by pipeline. The lique-fying of natural gas greatly reduces its net energy yield and increases its cost.\nFIGURE 13.7   Tar sands mining operation in Alberta, Canada.\nProducing heavy oil from tar sands \nhas a high environmental impact.Christopher Kolaczan/Shutterstock.com\nFIGURE 13.8   Using heavy oil from tar sands and from oil shale rock \nas an energy resource has advantages and disadvantages (Concept \n13.2).

The United States and China had 4.5% and 1.7%, respectively, of the world\u2019s proven natural gas reserves. Japan has no significant natural gas reserves and depends heavily on imports of expensive LNG.\nIn 2012, the world\u2019s three largest producers of natural \ngas were the United States (20% of global production), Russia (18%), and Iran (5%), and the three largest consum-ers were the United States (using 22% of the global total), Russia (11%), and Iran (5%). (See Figure 2 in Supplement 5 for a graph showing U.S. natural gas consumption between 1980 and 2012, with projections to 2040.) Currently, the United States does not have to rely on natural gas imports because its production has been increasing rapidly, mostly because of the growing use of fracking in shale rock beds (Science Focus 13.1), which accounted for about 30% of U.S. natural gas production in 2012 (up from 2% in 2000).\nThe demand for natural gas in the United States is pro-\njected to more than double between 2010 and 2050. If much of this demand is met by increased production of natural gas from shale rock, the United States could con-tinue to meet its needs for natural gas from domestic re-sources. However, U.S. natural gas reserves might have been overestimated. In 2011, the USGS cut its nationwide estimate of recoverable natural gas from shale rock by 50% and pointed out that natural gas production from shale rock tends to peak and drop off much faster than does production from conventional natural gas wells.\nIn addition, extracting and producing natural gas from \nshale rock reduces the net energy yield and, without effec-tive regulation, can increase the harmful environmental impacts of production (see Case Study that follows). Fig-ure 13.9 lists the advantages and disadvantages of using conventional natural gas as an energy resource.\nCASE STUDY\nNatural Gas Production and Fracking in the \nUnited States\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that, \nwithin a decade or two, at least 100,000 more natural gas wells will be drilled and fracked in the United States. If this projection holds, such wells could be producing 50% of the country\u2019s natural gas by 2040, up from 30% in 2012. Some analysts warn that without more monitoring and regulation of the entire natural gas production and distri-bution process, including fracking, the greatly increased production of natural gas (and oil) from shale rock could have several harmful environmental effects:\n\u2022\t Fracking\n\trequires\tenormous \tvolumes\tof\twater.\tA\t\ntypical fracking operation pumps about 18.9 million \nliters (5 million gallons) of water and chemicals underground. At least half of this water remains deep underground, permanently removed from the water cycle. In water-short areas this could help to reduce available surface water, deplete aquifers, degrade aquatic habitats, and diminish the availability of  \nwater for irrigation and other purposes. About  \nhalf of the fracked wells in the United States are  \nin water-stressed areas.\n\u2022\t Each\n\tfracked\twell\tproduces \thuge\tvolumes\tof\thazardous \t\nwastewater that are brought to the surface along with the released natural gas.

For example, numerous fracking wells near the small Wyoming town of Pinedale have led to smog levels equivalent to those typical of Los Angeles, California.\n\u2022\t According\n\tto\ta\t2012\tstudy\tby\tthe\tNational\tAcademy \t\nof Sciences and another study by the USGS, in recent years, one of the causes of hundreds of small earthquakes in 13 states has been the shifting of bedrock resulting from the high-pressure injection of fracking wastewater into deep underground hazardous waste wells. In some areas, the fracking process itself is suspected of causing small earthquakes. Such earthquakes could release hazardous wastewater into aquifers and cause breaks in the steel linings and cement seals of oil and gas well pipes. Between 2012 and 2014, the U.S. state of Ohio shut down some fracking operations and deep disposal wells after several small earthquakes occurred near these sites.\nProducers point out that increased natural gas produc-\ntion from fracking has lowered U.S. natural gas prices and \nbenefitted those who use natural gas (55% of all U.S. con-sumers). In addition, the natural gas fracking boom in Pennsylvania created about 18,000 jobs, and producers paid millions of dollars to land owners for signing leases to the gas under their land, along with royalties on the gas removed. And with more electricity generated by use of natural gas, the resulting drop in the use of coal to produce electricity has reduced emissions of CO\n2 and other air pollutants.\nProducers also argue that no groundwater contamina-\ntion directly due to fracking has ever been recorded, mostly because the fracking takes place far below drinking-water aquifers (Figure 13.A). However, critics contend that natural gas producers have squelched numerous reports of drinking water contamination near fracking sites by offering finan-cial settlements to people who make such claims. To receive payments, those people must promise not to reveal any in-formation about the alleged contamination. In 2014, docu-ments obtained from the state governments of Pennsylvania, Texas, Ohio, and West Virginia revealed hundreds of com-plaints since 2003 about contamination and diminished water flow from private water wells due to oil and natural gas production. Most of the confirmed examples of pollu-tion involved methane gas in drinking water (Figure 13.10).\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA), the natural gas and petroleum industry is the largest source of methane emissions into the atmosphere from hu-man activities, followed by releases from livestock (mostly their belching), landfills, and coal mining. About two-thirds of global emissions of methane\u2014a potent green-house gas\u2014are caused by human activities, and emissions have been increasing since 2007, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nMethane can also reach the air, and possibly aquifers, \nfrom the large number of wells abandoned by small pro-ducers that declared bankruptcy without sealing the wells properly and reclaiming the disturbed land. Such problems indicate that inspection and regulation of the entire natu-ral gas production process by the state and federal govern-ments is inadequate.\nCurrently, people who rely on aquifers and streams for \ntheir drinking water in areas undergoing rapid increases in shale gas production have little protection from pollution of their air and water supplies that might result from natural gas production.

Coal is also burned in industrial plants to make steel, cement, and other prod-ucts. In 2012, the three largest producers of coal were China (48% of global total), the United States (13%), and Australia (6%), and the three largest consumers were China (50%), the United States (12%), and India (8%). In 2013, China consumed roughly as much coal as the rest of the world combined. (See Figure 3, p. S40, in Supplement 5 for a graph showing global coal consumption between 1950 and 2012 and Figure 4, p. S40, for graphs showing coal consumption in the United States and China between 1965 and 2012.)\nIn 2012, the three countries with the world\u2019s largest \nproven coal reserves were the United States (28% of global total), Russia (18%), and China (13%). The USGS estimates that identified U.S. coal reserves (see Figures 15 and 16, pp. S32 and S33, in Supplement 4) could last about 250 years at the current consumption rate.\nThe problem is that coal is by far the dirtiest of all fossil \nfuels, starting with the mining of coal, which severely de-grades land (see Figures 12.9 through 12.11, pp. 297\u2013298) and pollutes water and air. Coal is mostly carbon but con-tains small amounts of sulfur, which are converted to the air pollutant sulfur dioxide (SO\n2) when the coal burns. Currently, China is the world\u2019s leading emitter of SO 2. \nThese emissions contribute to the problem of acid precipi-tation and to serious human health problems.\nThe burning of coal also releases large amounts of \nblack carbon particulates, or soot (Figure 13.13), and much smaller, fine particles of air pollutants such as toxic mercury. The fine particles can get past our bodies\u2019 natural defenses and into our lungs, causing various severe ill-nesses. According to a 2010 study by the Clean Air Task Force, fine-particle pollution in the United States, mostly from the older coal-burning power plants without the lat-est air pollution control technology, kills at least 13,000 people a year\u2014an average of 3 people every 2 hours. In China, outdoor air pollution from the burning of coal con-tributes to 1.2 million premature deaths per year (137 per hour), according to a 2010 study by University of Wash-ington scientists and the World Health Organization.\nCoal-burning power and industrial plants are among \nthe largest emitters of the greenhouse gas CO\n2 (Figure \n13.14), which is contributing to atmospheric warming and projected climate change (covered in Chapter 15). Coal combustion produces about 39% of global CO\n2 emissions. \nChina leads the world in such emissions, followed by the United States. Another problem with coal combustion is that it emits trace amounts of radioactive materials as well as toxic mercury into the atmosphere.\nIn addition, many coal-burning plants employ scrub-\nbers to remove some of these pollutants before they leave the smokestacks, and this produces coal ash (Figure 13.12)\u2014a toxic mix that can contain dangerous, inde-structible chemical elements such as arsenic, lead, mer -\ncury, cadmium, and radioactive radium.

After it is mined, the ore must be \nenriched to increase the concentration of its fissionable uranium-235 by 1% to 5%. The enriched uranium-235 is processed into small pellets of uranium dioxide. Each pel-let, about the size of an eraser on a pencil, contains the energy equivalent of about a ton of coal. Large numbers of the pellets are packed into closed pipes, called fuel rods, which are then grouped together in fuel assemblies, to be placed in the core of a reactor.\nTo regulate the amount of power produced, plant op-\nerators use control rods, moving them into and out of the reactor core to absorb more or fewer neutrons, thereby slowing or speeding the fission reaction. A coolant, usually water, circulates through the reactor\u2019s core to remove heat and keep the fuel rods and other reactor components from melting and releasing massive amounts of radioac-tivity into the environment. An LWR includes an emer -\ngency core cooling system as a backup to help prevent such meltdowns.A containment shell made of thick, steel-reinforced con-\ncrete surrounds the reactor core. It is designed to help keep radioactive materials from escaping into the environment, in case there is an internal explosion or a core meltdown. It is also intended to protect the core from external threats such as tornadoes and plane crashes. These essential safety features help to explain why a new nuclear power plant costs as much as $10 billion and why that cost is on the rise. In 2013, nuclear power produced about 4% of the world\u2019s energy and 8% of the energy used in the United States. In that year, the world\u2019s three leading producers of nuclear power were, in order, the United States, France, and Rus-sia. France generates 75% of its electricity and the United States generates 19% of its electricity using nuclear power.\nWhat Is the Nuclear Fuel Cycle?\nBuilding and running a nuclear power plant is only one part of the nuclear fuel cycle (Figure 13.17), which also includes the mining of uranium, processing and enriching \nOpen fuel cycle today\nRecycling of nuclear fuelFuel assemblies\nFuel fabricationReactor\nEnrichment\nof UF6\n(conversion of enriched\nUF6 to UO2 and fabrication\nof fuel assemblies)Temporary storage\nof spent fuel assemblies\nunderwater or in dry casksConversionof U\n3O8\nto UF6\nLow-level radiationwith long half-life\nGeologic disposalof moderate-and high-levelradioactive wastesMining uraniumore (U\n3O8)Decommissioningof reactor\nSpent fuelreprocessingUranium-235 as UF\n6\nPlutonium-239 as PuO2\nFIGURE 13.17   Using nuclear power to produce electricity involves a sequence of steps and technol-\nogies that together are called the nuclear power fuel cycle .

Figure 13.18 lists the major advantages and disad-vantages of producing electricity by using the nuclear power fuel cycle (Concept 13.3).\nLet\u2019s look more closely at some of the challenges in-\nvolved in using nuclear power.\nDealing with Radioactive Nuclear Wastes Is \na Difficult Scientific and Political Problem\nThe high-grade uranium fuel in a typical nuclear reactor \nlasts for 3\u20134 years, after which it becomes spent, or useless, and must be replaced. The spent-fuel rods are so thermally hot and highly radioactive that they cannot be simply thrown away. Researchers have found that 10 years after being removed from a reactor, a single spent-fuel rod as-sembly can still emit enough radiation to kill a person standing 1 meter (39 inches) away in less than 3 minutes.\nAfter spent-fuel rod assemblies are removed from reac-\ntors, they are stored in water-filled pools (Figure 13.19, left). After several years of cooling and decay of some of their radioactivity, they can be transferred to dry casks made of heat-resistant metal alloys and concrete and filled with inert helium gas (Figure 13.19, right). These casks are li-censed for 20 years and could last for 100 or more years\u2014only a tiny fraction of the thousands of years that the radioactive waste must be safely stored.

This reprocessing reduces the storage time for the remaining wastes from up to 240,000 years (longer than the current version of the hu-man species has been around) to about 10,000 years.\nHowever, reprocessing is very costly and produces \nbomb-grade plutonium that can be used by nations or ter -\nrorists to make nuclear weapons, as India did in 1974. This is mainly why the U.S. government, after spending billions of dollars, abandoned this fuel recycling approach in 1977. Currently, France, Russia, Japan, India, the United King-dom, and China reprocess some of their nuclear fuel.\nMost scientists and engineers agree in principle that \ndeep burial in an underground repository is the safest and cheapest way to store high-level radioactive wastes for thousands of years. However, some scientists contend that it is not possible to demonstrate that this or any storage method will work for thousands of years.\nBetween 1987 and 2009, the DOE spent $12 billion on \nresearch and testing for a long-term underground nuclear waste storage site in the Yucca Mountain desert region of Nevada. In 2010, this project was abandoned for scientific and political reasons. A government panel is looking for al-ternative solutions and sites. Some geologists have suggested that nuclear waste might be stored in impermeable shale rock formations, like those used to produce oil and natural gas. Research will be needed to evaluate this option. Mean-while these deadly wastes are building up, with about 78% stored in pools and 22% stored in dry casks (Figure 13.19).\nAnother radioactive waste problem arises when a nu-\nclear power plant reaches the end of its useful life after about 40 to 60 years and must be decommissioned, or closed and torn down. Around the world, 285 of the 430 com-mercial nuclear reactors operating in 2014 will have to be decommissioned by 2025.\nEventually all nuclear plants will have to be disman-\ntled and their high-level radioactive materials will have to be stored safely. Scientists have proposed three ways to do this. One strategy is to remove and store the highly radio-active parts in a permanent, secure repository. A second approach is to install a physical barrier around the plant and set up full-time security for 30\u2013100 years, until the plant can be dismantled after its radioactivity has reached safer levels. These levels would still be high enough to require long-term safe storage of leftover materials.\nA third option is to enclose the entire plant in a concrete \nand steel-reinforced tomb, called a containment structure. This is what was done with a reactor at Chernobyl, Ukraine, that exploded and nearly melted down in 1986, due to a combination of poor reactor design and human operator error. The explosion and the radiation released over large areas have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of peo-ple and contaminated a vast area of land with long-lasting radioactive fallout. A few years after the containment struc-ture was built, it began to crumble and leak radioactive wastes, due to the corrosive nature of the radiation inside the damaged reactor. The structure is being rebuilt at great cost and is unlikely to last even several hundred years.\nRegardless of the method chosen, the high costs of re-\ntiring nuclear plants adds to the enormous costs of the nuclear power fuel cycle and reduces its already low net energy yield.

Scientists point out that this is only partially correct. While nuclear plants are operating, they do not emit CO\n2. However, dur -\ning the 10 years that it typically takes to build a plant, es-pecially in the manufacturing of huge quantities of construction cement, large amounts of CO\n2 are emitted. \nEvery other step in the nuclear power fuel cycle (Figure 13.17) also involves CO\n2 emissions. Such emissions are \nmuch lower than those from coal-burning power plants (Figure 13.14) but they still contribute to atmospheric warming and projected climate change.\nExperts Disagree about the Future of \nNuclear Power\nIn the 1950s, researchers predicted that by the year 2000, \nat least 1,800 nuclear power plants would supply 21% of the world\u2019s commercial energy (25% of that in the United States) and most of the world\u2019s electricity. After almost 60 years of development, a huge financial investment, and enormous government subsidies, some 430 commercial nuclear reactors in 31 countries produced only 4% of the world\u2019s commercial energy and 15% of its electricity in 2012. In the United States, 100 licensed commercial nu-clear power reactors generated about 8% of the country\u2019s overall energy and 19% of its electricity in 2012.\nGlobally in 2013, 15 new nuclear reactors were under \nconstruction (8 of them in China, which had 17 reactors in 2012). Another 156 reactors are planned (most of them in China), but even if they are completed after a decade or two, they will not begin to replace the 285 aging reactors that must be decommissioned by 2025.

S40, \nin Supplement 5) and is now the world\u2019s slowest-growing form of commercial energy. In the United States, the amount of electricity produced from nuclear power leveled off between 2000 and 2010 and has dropped since then.\nThe future of nuclear power is a subject of debate. Crit-\nics argue that the most serious problem with the nuclear power fuel cycle is that it is uneconomical. They contend that the nuclear power industry could not exist without high levels of financial support from governments and taxpayers, because of the extraordinarily high cost of en-suring safety and the low net energy yield of the nuclear fuel cycle (Figure 13.2).\nFor example, the U.S. government has provided large \nresearch and development subsidies, tax breaks, and loan guarantees to the industry (with taxpayers accepting the risk of any debt defaults) for more than 50 years. It also as-sumes most of the financial burden of finding ways to store radioactive wastes. In addition, the government provides accident insurance guarantees (under the Price-Anderson Act passed by Congress in 1957), because insurance com-panies have refused to fully insure any nuclear reactor against the consequences of a catastrophic accident.\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService, since 1948, the U.S. government has spent more than $95 billion (in 2011 dollars) on nuclear energy re-search and development (R & D)\u2014more than four times the amount spent on R & D for solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, biofuels, and hydropower combined. Many ana-lysts question the need for continuing such taxpayer sup-port for nuclear power.\nBecause of the multiple built-in safety features, the risk \nof exposure to radioactivity from nuclear power plants in the United States and in most other more-developed countries is very low. However, several explosions and partial or complete meltdowns have occurred (see the fol-lowing Case Study). These accidents have dampened pub-lic and investor confidence in nuclear power.\nAnother serious safety concern related to commercial \nnuclear power is the spread of nuclear weapons technol-ogy around the world. In the international marketplace, the United States and 14 other countries have been selling commercial and experimental nuclear reactors and ura-nium fuel-enrichment and purification technology for decades. Much of this information and equipment can be used to produce bomb-grade uranium and plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. Energy expert John Holdren pointed out that the 60 countries that have nuclear weap-ons or the knowledge to develop them have gained most of such information by using civilian nuclear power tech-nology. Some critics see this as the single most important reason for not building more nuclear power plants.\nProponents of nuclear power argue that governments \nshould continue funding research, development, and pilot-plant testing of potentially safer and less costly new types of reactors. The nuclear industry claims that hundreds of \nnew advanced light-water reactors (ALWRs) could be built in \njust a few years. ALWRs have built-in safety features de-signed to make meltdowns and releases of radioactive emissions almost impossible. The industry is also evaluat-ing the development of smaller modular light-water reac-tors\u2014about the size of a school bus\u2014that could be built in a factory, delivered to a site, and installed underground.\nSome scientists call for replacing today\u2019s uranium-\nbased reactors with new ones to be fueled by thorium. They argue that such reactors would be much less costly and safer because they cannot melt down. Also, the nu-clear waste they produce cannot be used to make nuclear weapons. China plans to explore this option.\nSome analysts believe that, in order to be environmen-\ntally and economically acceptable, any new-generation nuclear technology should meet the five criteria listed in Figure 13.20.

An immense \nwave of seawater washed over the nuclear plant\u2019s protec-tive seawalls and knocked out the circuits and backup diesel generators of the emergency core cooling systems for three of the reactors. Then, explosions (presumably from the buildup of hydrogen gas) blew the roofs off three of the reactor buildings and released radioactivity into the atmosphere and nearby coastal waters.\nEvidence indicates that the cores of these three reac-\ntors suffered full meltdowns and contaminated a large area with low to moderate levels of radioactivity. In 2013, ra-dioactivity from contaminated groundwater and from one of the plant\u2019s 1,000 wastewater storage tanks was leaking into the coastal waters near the plant. Officials say the costly cleanup and decommissioning of the damaged reac-tors will take several decades.\nThe tsunami killed about 8,200 people and coupled \nwith the nuclear plant disaster created 270,000 refugees, with 3,000 refugees dying from medical problems and sui-cides. This event greatly damaged the confidence of Japa-nese citizens in the safety of nuclear power and led the government to shut down all of the country\u2019s nuclear re-actors and consider abandoning its use of nuclear power. By 2013 Japan was relying more on imports of expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) and much cheaper coal to pro-duce electricity. In 2013, Japan was the world\u2019s second largest importer of coal (much of it from Australia) after China. Japan\u2019s serious nuclear power accident also prompted Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium to an-nounce plans for phasing out nuclear power.\nIs Nuclear Fusion the Answer?\nOther proponents of nuclear power hope to develop \n nuclear fusion\u2014a nuclear change at the atomic level in which the nuclei of two isotopes of a light element such as hydrogen are forced together at extremely high tempera-tures until they fuse to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy in the process (see Figure 14, bottom, p. S13,  \nin Supplement 3). Some scientists hope that controlled nuclear fusion will provide an almost limitless source  \nof energy.\nWith nuclear fusion, there would be no risk of a melt-\ndown or of a release of large amounts of radioactive mate-rials, and little risk of the additional spread of nuclear weapons. Fusion power might also be used to destroy toxic wastes and to supply electricity for desalinating water and for decomposing water to produce hydrogen fuel as a very clean-burning energy source.\nHowever, in the United States, after more than 50 \nyears of research and a $25 billion investment (mostly by the government), controlled nuclear fusion is still in the laboratory stage. None of the approaches tested so far has produced more energy than they used. In 2006, the United States, China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, India, and the European Union agreed to spend at least $12.8 billion in a joint effort to build a large-scale experimental nuclear fusion reactor by 2026 to determine if it can pro-duce a net energy yield at an affordable cost. By 2012, the estimated cost of this project had doubled and it was far behind schedule. Unless there is an unexpected scientific breakthrough, some skeptics say, \u201cNuclear fusion is the power of the future and always will be.\u201d\n13.4 WHY IS ENERGY EFFICIENCY \nAN IMPORTANT ENERGY RESOURCE?\nCONCEPT 13.4   Improvements in energy efficiency could \nsave at least a third of the energy used in the world and up \nto 43% of the energy used in the United States.\nWe Use Energy Inefficiently\nEnergy efficiency is a measure of how much useful work \nwe can get from each unit of energy we use.

The other 43% is wasted unnecessarily, mostly due to the inefficiency of industrial motors, most motor vehicles, power plants, and numerous other energy-consuming devices.\nAnother reason for our inefficient use of energy is that \nmany people live and work in poorly insulated, badly de-signed buildings that require excessive heating during cold weather and excessive cooling during hot weather. Also, many Americans live in ever-expanding suburban areas around large cities where they must depend on cars for getting around. Roughly three of every four Americans commute to work, mostly in energy-inefficient vehicles, and only 5% rely on more energy-efficient mass transit.\nWe waste large amounts of high-quality energy and \nmoney by relying on various energy-inefficient devices. One example is the huge data centers that process informa-\ntion flowing on the Internet and provide space for cloud-based data storage services. Typically they use only about 10% of the electrical energy they pull off of the grid. The other 90% ends up as low-quality heat that flows into the environment. Most of these centers run 24 hours a day at their maximum capacities regardless of the demand, and they require large amounts of energy for cooling. Another example is the internal combustion engine, which propels most motor vehicles. Only about 20% of the money peo-ple spend on gasoline provides them with transportation. The other 80% of the energy released by burning gasoline ends up as waste heat in the atmosphere.\nBy improving energy efficiency, we can gain numerous \neconomic and environmental benefits (Figure 13.22). To most energy analysts, it is the quickest, cleanest, and usually the cheapest way to provide more energy, reduce pollution and environmental degradation, and slow projected climate change and ocean acidification.\nWe Can Improve Energy Efficiency in \nIndustries and Utilities\nIndustry accounts for about 30% of the world\u2019s energy \nconsumption and 33% of U.S. energy consumption, mostly for producing metals, chemicals, petrochemicals, cement, and paper. There are several ways in which indus-tries can improve their energy efficiency and save money in the process (Concept 13.4).\nOne way to save energy is to use cogeneration, which \ninvolves using a combined heat and power (CHP) system. For example, the steam used for generating electricity in a CHP system can be captured and used again to heat the plant or other nearby buildings, rather than released into the environment as waste heat. The energy efficiency of these systems is 75\u201390%. Denmark leads the world by get-ting 52% of its electricity from CHP systems, compared to 8% in the United States.\nIndustries can also use more energy-efficient electric \nmotors. Most of the widely used inefficient motors run only at full speed with their output throttled to match the task\u2014somewhat like using one foot to push the gas pedal to the floorboard of your car and putting your other foot on the brake pedal to control its speed. They can be re-placed with more energy-efficient variable-speed motors, which run at the minimum rate needed for each job.\nRecycling materials such as steel and other metals is a \nthird way for industry to save energy and money. For ex-ample, producing steel from recycled scrap iron uses 75% less high-quality energy than does producing steel from virgin iron ore, and it emits 40% less CO\n2. A fourth way is \nto use more energy-efficient compact fluorescent and LED lighting.\nYet another way to save energy would be to redesign \nthe software and cooling systems in electronic data pro-cessing systems. Servers could also be powered down when they are not in use and throttled back automatically when data traffic is light.\nA growing number of major corporations are saving \nmoney by improving energy efficiency.

Grid systems of high-voltage transmission lines carry electricity from power plants, wind farms (Core Case Study), and other electricity producers to users. In the United States, many energy ex-perts place top priority on converting and expanding to-day\u2019s outdated electrical grid system into a regional and national smart grid. This would be an energy-efficient, digi-\ntally controlled, ultra-high-voltage (UHV) system with superefficient transmission lines. According to the DOE, building such a grid would cost the United States up to $800 billion over the next 20 years but would save the U.S. economy up to $2 trillion during that period. Much of this savings would go directly to consumers, because the system would include smart electric meters to help con-sumers use their energy as efficiently as possible.\nSolar and wind power, used to generate electricity, are \nthe fastest growing energy resources in the world and in the United States (see Figures 6 and 7, p. S41, in Supple-ment 5). However, their growth will be limited unless the new wind farms and solar cell power plants being built in sparsely populated areas can be connected to a smart grid. Such a grid could quickly adjust for a major power loss in one area by automatically bringing in electricity from other parts of the country. It would also make it easier for power companies and consumers to buy electricity pro-duced from wind, solar, and other renewable forms of energy in areas where they are not directly available.\nWe Can Improve Energy Efficiency and \nSave Money in Transportation\nBetween 1973 and 2013, the average fuel economy for new \ncars and light trucks in the United States increased from  \n5 kilometers per liter, or kpl (11.9 miles per gallon, or mpg) to 10.6 kpl (24.9 mpg). The government goal is for such vehicles to get 23.3 kpl (54.5 mpg) by 2025. Energy experts such as Joseph Romm argue that all new cars and light trucks sold in the United States could get more than 43 kpl (100 mpg), using available technology, by 2040, and they call for such government standards. Fuel economy stan-dards for new vehicles in Europe, Japan, China, and Can-ada are much higher than are those in the United States.\nOne reason why many consumers buy large, ineffi-\ncient motor vehicles is that they do not realize that gaso-line costs them much more than the price they pay at the pump. The hidden costs not included in the market price of gasoline include government subsidies and tax breaks for oil companies, car manufacturers, and road builders; costs of pollution control and cleanup; and higher medical bills and health insurance premiums resulting from illnesses caused by air and water pollution from the production and use of motor vehicles.Consumers pay these hidden costs, but not at the gas \npump. According to a study by the International Center for Technology Assessment, the hidden costs of gasoline for U.S. consumers are about $3.18 per liter ($12 per gal-lon). Thus, when gas costs $3 a gallon, U.S. consumers are really paying about $15 a gallon.\nOne way to include more of these hidden costs in the \nmarket price, and thus implement the full-cost pricing principle of sustainability, is through higher gaso-line taxes, which are widely used in Europe but are politically unpopular in the United States. Some analysts call for increasing U.S. gasoline taxes and reducing payroll and income taxes to balance such increases, thereby re-lieving consumers of any additional financial burden. An-other way for governments to encourage higher energy efficiency in transportation is to give consumers significant tax breaks or other economic incentives to encourage them to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles.\nOther ways to save energy and money in transporta-\ntion include building or expanding mass transit", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3995, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d3b08cd-c568-4cc1-8674-0b72f97a5bb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d3b08cd-c568-4cc1-8674-0b72f97a5bb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "334", "file_name": "G.

Another approach is to encourage bicycle use by building bike lanes along highways and city streets.\nEnergy-Efficient Vehicles Are Available\nThere is growing interest in developing superefficient, ul-tralight, and ultrastrong cars using existing technology. One of these vehicles is the energy-efficient, gasoline-electric hybrid car (Figure 13.23, left). These cars have a small, tra-ditional gasoline-powered engine and a battery-powered electric motor used to provide the energy needed for ac-celeration and hill climbing. The most efficient current models of these cars get a combined city/highway mileage of up to 21 kpl (50 mpg) and emit about 65% less CO\n2 per \nkilometer driven than do comparable conventional cars.\nAnother option is the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (Fig-\nure 13.23, right). Such vehicles can travel 48\u201397 kilometers (30\u201360 miles) on electricity alone. Then the small gasoline motor kicks in, recharges the battery, and extends the driv-ing range to 600 kilometers (370 miles) or more. The bat-tery can be plugged into a conventional 110-volt outlet and fully charged in 6 to 8 hours, or in a much shorter time using a 220-volt outlet. Still another option is an all-electric vehicle that runs on a battery only. The problem for the average consumer is that the prices on hybrid, plug-in hy-brid, and all-electric cars are high because of the high cost of their batteries.\nAccording to a DOE study, replacing most of the cur -\nrent U.S. vehicle fleet with plug-in hybrid vehicles over 3 decades would cut U.S. oil consumption by 70\u201390%, eliminate the need for costly oil imports, save consumers money, and reduce CO\n2 emissions by 27%.

This would help to reduce \nprojected climate change and save thousands of lives by reducing air pollution from motor vehicles and from coal-burning power plants.\nThe key to greatly increasing the use of hybrid, plug-in \nhybrid, and all-electric motor vehicles is to ramp up re-search and development of improved, more affordable batteries (Science Focus 13.2). Another important factor will be to build a network of recharging stations in many convenient locations within and between communities.\nA future stage in the development of superefficient cars \nmight be an electric vehicle that uses a fuel cell\u2014a device that uses hydrogen gas (H\n2) as a fuel to produce electricity \nwhen it reacts with oxygen gas (O 2) in the atmosphere and \nemits harmless water vapor. Fuel cells are at least twice as efficient as internal combustion engines, have no moving parts, and require little maintenance. Their H\n2 fuel is usu-\nally produced with the use of electricity, and if such electric-ity could be generated by wind or solar power, the widespread use of fuel cells would drastically reduce air pollution and CO\n2 emissions that contribute to projected \nclimate change\u2014two of the world\u2019s most serious environ-mental, economic, and health problems. However, in the short run, such cars will probably be very expensive, in part because H\n2 has a negative net energy yield, as discussed \nlater in this chapter. GREEN CAREER:  Fuel-cell technology\nWe can also improve a vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency by re-\nducing its weight. One way to do this is to make car bodies out of ultralight and ultrastrong composite materials such as fiberglass, carbon fiber, hemp-fiber, and graphene. The current cost of making such car bodies is high, but mass production would likely bring these costs down.We Can Design Buildings That Save Energy \nand Money\nWe know how to make a transition to living and working \nin more sustainable buildings over the next few decades. For example, if a building is oriented to face the sun, it can get more of its heat from solar energy, which can cut heat-ing costs by up to 20%. This is a simple application of the solar energy principle of sustainability that people have been using for centuries. Heating costs can be cut by as much as 75% when the building is well insulated and airtight.\nGreen architecture, based on energy-efficient, resource-\nefficient, and money-saving designs, employs several old and new technologies. Along with natural lighting, direct solar heating, insulated windows, and energy-efficient ap-pliances and lighting, it makes use of solar hot water heat-ers, electricity from solar cells, windows that darken automatically to deflect heat from the sun, thin sheets of aerogel insulation, and recycling of wastewater. Some homes and urban buildings also have living roofs, or green roofs, covered with specially designed soil and vegetation (Figure 13.24). Such a roof can reduce the costs of cooling and heating a building by absorbing heat from the summer sun and helping to insulate the structure and retain heat in the winter. \nGREEN CAREERS:  Sustainable environ-\nmental design and architecture\nSuperinsulation is very important in energy-efficient \ndesign. A house can be so heavily insulated and airtight that heat from direct sunlight, appliances, and human bodies can warm it with little or no need for a backup heating system, even in extremely cold climates. Superin-sulated houses in Sweden use 90% less energy for heating and cooling than do typical American homes of the same size. One example of superinsulation is straw-bale con-FIGURE 13.23   Solutions: A conventional gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle (left) is powered mostly by a \nsmall internal combustion engine with an assist from a", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3903, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d227016e-6cbb-41f5-8378-01c44c8bfce4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d227016e-6cbb-41f5-8378-01c44c8bfce4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "335", "file_name": "G.

Such walls can have insulating values of 2 to 6 times those of conventional walls. (See the online guest essay by Nancy Wicks on this topic.)\nGreen building certification standards have been ad-\nopted in 21 countries, thanks to the efforts of the World Green Building Council. Between 1999 and 2012, the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program has awarded sil-ver, gold, and platinum standard certificates to more than 44,200 U.S. buildings that meet certain efficiency and environmental standards\u2014the largest number by far of any country. The Sustainable Building Coalition has pro-posed that we go further and evaluate the sustainability of buildings over their lifetimes according to measurements of energy use, water use, CO\n2 emissions, outputs of solid \nand hazardous wastes, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality.We Can Save Money and Energy in \nExisting Buildings\nHere are some ways to save energy and money in existing \nbuildings:\n\u2022\tInsulate the building and plug leaks. About one-third  \nof the heated air in typical U.S. homes and other \nbuildings escapes through holes, cracks, and single-pane windows (Figure 13.26). During hot weather, these windows and cracks let heat in, which increases the need for air conditioning.\n\u2022\tUse energy-efficient windows. They can cut heat losses by two-thirds in winter, and cut summer cooling costs.\n\u2022\tStop other heating and cooling losses. Seal leaky heating and cooling ducts in attics and unheated basements.\n\u2022\tHeat houses and other buildings more efficiently. In order, the most energy-efficient ways to heat indoor space or to conserve indoor heat are: superinsulation (including plugging leaks); a geothermal heat pump that transfers \nThe major obstacle standing in the \nway of wider use of plug-in hybrid-\nelectric and all-electric vehicles is the need for an affordable, small, light-weight, and easily rechargeable car battery that can store enough energy to power a vehicle over long distances.\nOne promising type of battery is the \nlithium-ion battery, commonly used in laptop computers and cell phones. These batteries are light (because lith-ium is the lightest solid chemical ele-ment) and can pack a lot of energy into a small space. They can be hooked together to power hybrid, plug-in hy-brid, and all-electric motor vehicles.\nMuch of the current research on \nbatteries involves nanotechnology (see Science Focus 12.1, p. 300). For exam-ple, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have de-veloped a new type of lithium-ion bat-tery using such technology. It is less expensive and can be charged 40 times faster than the batteries that are used to power many of today\u2019s hybrid vehicles.\nMIT researcher Angela Belcher is \nworking on another new type of bat-tery. She has genetically engineered a virus that can coat itself with electricity-  \nconducting materials to form a tiny nanowire. Belcher is trying to find ways to link these wires up to form the com-ponents of a battery far more compact and powerful than any yet developed. Such viral batteries would essentially grow themselves without producing the toxic wastes often associated with battery production and recycling.\nScientists have also developed ultra-\ncapacitors, which are small batteries that quickly store and release large amounts of electrical energy, thus pro-viding the power needed for quick ac-celeration. They can be recharged in minutes, can hold a charge much lon-ger than conventional batteries, and \nTHE SEARCH FOR BETTER BATTERIES\ndon\u2019t have to be replaced as frequently as conventional batteries.

One approach is to use a roof-mounted solar hot water heater. Another option is a tankless instant water heater fired by natural gas or LPG (but not an electric heater, which is inefficient) that can provide hot water for as long as it is needed.\n\u2022\tUse energy-efficient appliances. A refrigerator with its freezer in a drawer on the bottom uses about half as much energy as one with the freezer on top or on the side, which allows dense cold air to flow out quickly whenever the door is opened. Microwave ovens use 25\u201350% less electricity than electric stoves do for cooking and 20% less than convection ovens use. Clothes dryers with moisture sensors cut energy use  \nby 15%. Front-loading clothes washers use 55% less energy and 30% less water than top-loading models use and cut operating costs in half.\n\u2022\tStop using the standby mode. According to the DOE, keeping TVs and other electronic devices on standby when they are not being used consumes about 10% of the electricity used by a typical household. Consumers can reduce their energy use and their monthly power bills by plugging their standby electronic devices into smart power strips that cut off power to a device when it detects that the device has been turned off.\n\u2022\tUse energy-efficient computers. According to the EPA, if all computers sold in the United States met its Energy Star requirements, consumers would save $1.8 billion a year in energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equal to that of taking about 2 million cars off the road.\n\u2022\tUse energy-efficient lighting. As incandescent lightbulbs are being phased out, homeowners, colleges and universities, and businesses are switching to  \nmore energy-efficient and longer-lasting compact fluorescent light (CFL) and LED bulbs. LED bulbs  \nuse 85% less energy, save consumers money, and  \nlast up to 25 times as long as incandescent bulbs and  \n4 times as long as CFLs. When LED bulbs first came out, they cost $100 a bulb. In 2014, prices were  \ndown to $3\u2013$6 a bulb and still falling. The DOE estimates that rapid adoption of LED bulbs over the next 20 years in the United States would save consumers money and eliminate the need to build  \n40 new power plants. Another way to make lighting more efficient is to use automatic motion sensors to turn lights on and off as needed.\nFigure 13.27 summarizes several ways in which you \ncan cut your energy use and save money in the place \nwhere you live.\nWhy Are We Still Wasting So Much Energy \nand Money?\nConsidering its impressive array of benefits (Figure 13.22), \nwhy is there so little emphasis on improving energy effi-ciency?

According to conservative estimates by the International Energy Agency and the Global Subsidies Ini-tiative, in 2011, governments around the world spent more than $620 billion on subsidies for the highly profit-able fossil fuels industry compared to $88 billion on subsi-dies for renewable energy. This distortion of the energy marketplace violates the full-cost pricing principle of sustainability.\nAnother reason for continuing energy waste is that \nthere are too few long-lasting government tax breaks, re-bates, low-interest long-term loans, and other economic incentives for investing in energy efficiency. A third reason is that some governments have not put a high priority on educating the public about the environmental and money-saving advantages of improving energy efficiency.\nIn 2011, when Japan was getting 30% of its electricity \nfrom nuclear power, an earthquake and tsunami shut down three of its nuclear reactors, and eventually all of them were closed, at least temporarily (Case Study,  \np. 331). Within three years, Japan was able to replace half of its lost nuclear power by reducing its use of electricity through conservation and by improvements in energy ef-ficiency.

As incandescent lightbulbs are being phased out, homeowners, colleges and universities, and businesses are switching to  \nmore energy-efficient and longer-lasting compact fluorescent light (CFL) and LED bulbs. LED bulbs  \nuse 85% less energy, save consumers money, and  \nlast up to 25 times as long as incandescent bulbs and  \n4 times as long as CFLs. When LED bulbs first came out, they cost $100 a bulb. In 2014, prices were  \ndown to $3\u2013$6 a bulb and still falling. The DOE estimates that rapid adoption of LED bulbs over the next 20 years in the United States would save consumers money and eliminate the need to build  \n40 new power plants. Another way to make lighting more efficient is to use automatic motion sensors to turn lights on and off as needed.\nFigure 13.27 summarizes several ways in which you \ncan cut your energy use and save money in the place \nwhere you live.\nWhy Are We Still Wasting So Much Energy \nand Money?\nConsidering its impressive array of benefits (Figure 13.22), \nwhy is there so little emphasis on improving energy effi-ciency?

We can get renewable solar energy directly from the sun or indirectly from wind (Core Case Study), flowing water, and biomass. Another form of renewable energy is geothermal energy, or heat from the earth\u2019s interior.\nStudies show that with increased and consistent gov-\nernment backing in the form of research and development funds, subsidies, and tax breaks, renewable energy could provide 20% of the world\u2019s electricity by 2025 and 50% by 2050. In 2012, thirteen countries got more than 30% of their electricity from renewable energy, compared to 13% in the United States. In that year, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory projected that, with a crash program, the United States could get 50% of its electricity from re-newable energy sources by 2050.\nChina is by far the world\u2019s largest user of coal and leads \nthe world in climate-changing CO\n2 emissions. China also has \nthe world\u2019s largest capacity for electricity from wind power and solar cells and plans to become the largest user and seller of wind turbines and solar cells\u2014projected to be two of the world\u2019s fastest growing businesses over the next few decades. China\u2019s goal is to greatly expand its production of electricity from renewable wind, sun, and flowing water (hydropower) to help reduce its use of coal and the resulting outdoor air pollution that kills about 1.2 million of its citizens each year.\nAccording to a 2014 report by the U.S. National Sci-\nence Foundation, in 2012, China spent $60 billion on clean energy investments compared to $20 billion spent by the United States and $20 billion spent by the European Union. However, between 2005 and 2013, China in-creased its production of coal by 1 billion metric tons\u2014an amount that took the United States 150 years to produce, according to energy expert Vaclav Smil. And by 2020, China plans to produce another billion metric tons of coal.\nEngineer, renewable energy advocate, and National \nGeographic Emerging Explorer Ibrahim Togola is promot-ing the use of renewable energy resources like solar, wind, and biofuel to produce electricity in rural areas of his na-tive country of Mali, Africa. His goal is to reduce deforesta-tion caused by reliance on wood and charcoal for 80% of the country\u2019s energy supply and contribute to wealth cre-ation in the country by promoting entrepreneurship. He has also helped villagers establish tree-planting programs to help replenish cleared forests.\nIf renewable energy is so great, why does it provide only \n8% of the world\u2019s energy (Figure 13.3) and 5% of the en-ergy used in the United States? There are four major rea-sons. First, since 1950, government tax breaks, subsidies, and \nfunding for research and development of renewable energy resources have been much lower than those for fossil fuels (especially oil) and nuclear power, although subsidies and tax breaks for renewables have increased in recent years.\nSecond, although government subsidies and tax breaks \nfor fossil fuels and nuclear power have essentially been guaranteed for many decades, those for renewable energy in the United States have to be renewed by Congress every few years. This measure is mostly a result of political pressure from the fossil fuel industry trying to head off competition from these rapidly developing technologies.

The resulting financial uncertainty makes it risky for entrepreneurs, com-panies, and homeowners to invest in renewable energy.\nThird, the prices we pay for nonrenewable fossil fuels \nand nuclear power do not include most of the harmful environmental and human health costs of producing and using them. This helps to shield them from free-market competition with renewable sources of energy.\nFourth, history shows that it has typically taken about \n50\u201360 years to make the transition from one dominant fuel to another, such as from wood to coal and from coal to oil and natural gas. Renewable wind and solar energy are the world\u2019s fastest growing sources of energy, but it will likely take decades for them to supply 25% or more of the world\u2019s energy or electricity.\nFossil fuel and utility companies fear losing business to \nwind- and solar-powered electricity, and they argue that both of these energy technologies are too expensive. However, the prices for electricity produced by the wind and sun are fall-  \ning very rapidly because of the development of new technologies and cost savings from mass production.\nWe Can Heat Buildings and Water with \nSolar Energy\nA building that has enough access to sunlight can get all or \nmost of its heat through a passive solar heating system (Figure 13.28, left). Such a system absorbs and stores heat from the sun directly within a well-insulated structure. Water tanks and walls and floors of concrete, adobe, brick, or stone can store much of the collected solar energy as heat and release it slowly throughout the day and night. In a passively heated building, a small backup heating system such as a vented natural gas or propane heater can be used, but is usu-ally not necessary in a well-designed and well-insulated build-ing. (See the online guest essay by Nancy Wicks on this topic.)\nAn active solar heating system (Figure 13.28, right) \ncaptures energy from the sun by pumping a heat-absorbing GOOD\nNEWS\n90446_ch13_312-357.indd   340 8/13/14   11:04 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Some of the collected heat can be used directly. The rest can be stored in large insulated con-tainers filled with gravel, water, clay, or a heat-absorbing chemical, and used as needed.\nRooftop active solar collectors are used to heat water in \nmany homes and apartment buildings. With systems that cost the equivalent of as little as $200, about one in ten houses and apartment buildings in China use the sun to provide hot water. Once the fairly low initial cost is paid, the hot water is heated for free. In Cairo, Egypt, urban planner and Emerging National Geographic Explorer Thomas Culhane has established a nongovernmental orga-nization that works with the residents of the poorest neigh-borhoods to install rooftop solar water heaters. According to the UN Development Programme, solar water heaters could be used to provide half of the world\u2019s hot water.\nPassive and active solar systems can be used to heat \nnew homes in areas with adequate sunlight. (See Figures 19 and 20, pp. S36 and S37, in Supplement 4 for maps showing solar energy availability throughout the world and in the United States, respectively.) Figure 13.29 lists the major advantages and disadvantages of using passive or active solar systems for heating buildings.\nWe Can Cool Buildings Naturally\nDirect solar energy works against us when we want to keep a building cool, but we can use indirect solar energy (mainly wind) to help cool buildings. For example, we can open windows to take advantage of breezes and use fans to keep the air moving. When there is no breeze, superin-sulation and high-efficiency windows help to keep hot air outside.

Solar thermal systems, also known as concen-\ntrated solar power (CSP), use different methods to collect and concentrate solar energy in order to boil water and produce steam for generating electricity. These systems are used mostly in desert areas with ample sunlight.\nOne such system uses troughs of curved collectors that \nconcentrate solar energy and use it to heat synthetic oil  \nin a pipe that runs through the center of each trough (Fig-ure 13.30, left). This concentrated heat\u2014as hot as 400\u00b0C (750\u00b0F)\u2014is used to boil water and produce steam that powers a turbine that drives a generator to produce elec-tricity. Another system (Figure 13.30, right) uses an array of computer-controlled mirrors to track the sun and focus its energy on a central power tower to provide enough heat to boil water that is used to produce electricity. The heat produced by either of these systems can also be used to melt a certain kind of salt stored in a large insulated container. The heat stored in this molten salt system can then be released as needed to produce electricity at night or on cloudy days.\nIn 2014, the world\u2019s largest solar thermal plant using \nmirrors opened in California\u2019s Mojave Desert. This $2.2 billion plant has 350,000 mirrors focused on three 40-story towers. It can produce enough electricity to power 140,000 homes and eliminate annual CO\n2 emissions equivalent to \ntaking 88,000 cars off the road.\nOne problem with solar thermal systems is that their \nnet energy yield is low, which means that they need large government subsidies or tax breaks in order to compete in the marketplace with alternatives that have higher net energy yields. Figure 13.31 summarizes the major advan-tages and disadvantages of concentrating solar energy to produce high-temperature heat or electricity.\nWe can use concentrated solar energy on a smaller scale, \nas well. In some sunny rural areas, people use inexpensive solar cookers to focus and concentrate sunlight for boiling and sterilizing water (Figure 13.32, left) and for cooking food (Figure 13.32, right). Solar cookers can replace wood and charcoal fires, thereby helping to reduce indoor air pol-lution, a major killer of many of the world\u2019s poor people. They also help to reduce deforestation by reducing the need for firewood and charcoal made from firewood.\nFIGURE 13.30   Solar thermal power:  \nThis solar power plant (left) in a Cali-\nfornia desert uses curved (parabolic) solar collectors to concentrate solar energy to provide enough heat to boil water and produce steam for generating electricity.

Most solar cells are thin wafers of purified silicon (Si) or polycrystalline silicon with trace amounts of metals that allow them to produce electricity.\nSolar cells have no moving parts and they operate \nsafely and quietly with no emissions of pollutants or green-house gases. A typical solar cell has a thickness ranging from less than that of a human hair to that of a sheet of paper. When sunlight strikes these transparent cells, they produce electricity (a flow of electrons), and many cells wired together in a panel can produce large amounts of electrical power. Such systems can be connected to existing electrical grid systems or to batteries that store the electrical energy until it is needed.\nWe can mount arrays of solar cells on rooftops and \nincorporate them into almost any type of roofing material. Nanotechnology and other emerging technologies will likely allow the manufacturing of solar cells in paper-thin, rigid or flexible sheets (see Figure 12.A, p. 302) that can be printed like newspapers and attached to or embedded in a variety of surfaces such as outdoor walls, windows, drapes, and clothing. Large solar-cell power plants are operating in Portugal, Spain, Germany, South Korea, the southwestern United States, and China (Figure 13.33).\nNearly 1.3 billion people, almost one of every five in \nthe world, do not have access to electricity that most of us take for granted. They live in energy poverty, mostly in less-developed countries in rural villages that are not con-nected to an electrical grid. A growing number of these individuals and villages now use solar cells to generate electricity (Figure 13.34) and to power highly efficient LED lamps that can replace polluting kerosene lamps.\nAs these small, off-grid systems reach more rural vil-\nlages they will help hundreds of millions of people to lift themselves out of poverty. Eventually, new local mi-crogrids of thin-film and other new types of solar cells are expected to drastically lower the cost of providing electric-ity to these areas. This could greatly reduce the need to build expensive and centralized coal and nuclear power plants and electrical grids to distribute power throughout countries such as India.\nSolar Thermal Systems\nLow net energy \nyield and high costs\nNeeds backup or \nstorage system on cloudy days\nRequires high \nwater use\nCan disrupt desert \necosystemsHigh potential for growth\nNo direct emissions \nof  CO\n2  and other \nair pollutants\nLower costs with \nnatural gas turbine backup\nSource of new jobsAdvantages DisadvantagesTrade-Offs\nFIGURE 13.31   Using solar energy to generate high-temperature \nheat and electricity has advantages and disadvantages (Concept \n13.5).

However, these emis-sions are small compared to those generated by the use of fossil fuels and the nuclear power fuel cycle. Conventional solar cells also contain toxic materials that must be recov-ered when the cells wear out after 20\u201325 years of use, or when they are replaced by new systems.\nOne problem with solar cells is that they have a low-to-\nmedium net energy yield, depending on the design and the production process. Solar cells typically convert only 20% of the incoming solar energy into electricity. Scientists and engineers are rapidly improving the efficiency of solar cells, which will increase their net energy yield. In 2014, researchers at Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems developed a solar cell with an efficiency of 45%. They plan to scale up this prototype cell for commer -\ncial use within 3 years. Also in 2014, Swedish scientist David Barbero and his colleagues found a way to use nanotubes that has the potential to make next-generation solar cells vastly more efficient. Figure 13.35 lists the major advantages and disadvantages of using solar cells.Between 2008 and 2012, the cost per watt of electricity \nproduced by solar cells in the United States fell by more than 75%, according to the DOE, and prices are expected to keep falling. As a result of government subsidies and tax breaks for solar cell producers and users, along with de-clining prices, solar cells have become the world\u2019s fastest growing way to produce electricity (see Figure 6, p. S41,  \nin Supplement 5). Production is likely to grow much more. Within the next decade or two, next generation thin-film nanotechnology and graphene solar cells (see Science Focus 12.2, p. 302), along with solar cells made with a class of mineral materials known as perovskites, are expected to become inexpensive enough to compete with fossil fuels, especially coal.\nJim Lyons, former chief engineer for General Electric, \ncontends that solar cells will be the world\u2019s number-one source of electricity by the end of this century. If that hap-pens, it will represent a huge global application of the  \nsolar energy principle of sustainability that would sharply reduce air pollution and help to slow cli-mate change. \nGREEN CAREER:  Solar-cell technology\nFIGURE 13.33   Solar-cell power plant located near the city of Shizuishan, China.

It is an indirect form of solar energy because it depends on the evaporation of water, which is deposited as rain or snow at higher elevations where it can flow to lower elevations in rivers as part of the earth\u2019s solar-powered water cycle (see Figure 3.13, p. 52).\nThe most common approach to harnessing hydropower \nis to build a high dam across a large river to create a reser -\nvoir. Some of the water stored in the reservoir is allowed to flow through large pipes at controlled rates to spin turbines that produce electricity (see Figure 11.12, p. 258).\nHydropower, the leading renewable energy resource, \nproduced about 16% of the world\u2019s electricity in 160 coun-tries in 2013. In order, the world\u2019s top three producers of hydropower are China, Brazil, and the United States. In 2013, hydropower supplied about 7% of the electricity used in the United States (but about 50% of that used on the West Coast). (See Figure 9, p. S42, in Supplement 5 for a graph showing the global growth of hydropower.)\nAccording to the UN, only about 13% of the world\u2019s \npotential for hydropower has been developed. Much of this untapped potential is in China, India, South America, Central Africa, and parts of the former Soviet Union. China, with the world\u2019s largest hydropower output, has plans to triple it by 2020 and is also building or funding more than 200 hydropower dams around the world.\nHowever, some analysts expect that the use of large-\nscale hydropower plants will fall slowly over the next several decades as many existing reservoirs fill with silt and become useless faster than new systems are built. Also, there is concern over emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from the decomposition of submerged vegetation in reservoirs, especially in warm climates.\nIn addition, if atmospheric temperatures continue to rise \nand contribute to climate change as projected, the electrical output of many of the world\u2019s large dams is likely to drop as mountain glaciers, a primary source of their water, will melt. Figure 13.36 lists the major advantages and disadvantages of using large-scale hydropower plants to produce electricity.\nThe use of microhydropower generators may become an \nincreasingly important way to produce electricity. These are floating turbines, each about the size of an overnight suitcase. They can be placed in any stream or river without altering its course to provide electricity at a very low cost with a very low environmental impact.

In some coastal bays and estuaries, water levels can rise or fall by 6 meters (20 feet) or more between daily high and low tides. Dams can be built across the mouths of such bays and es-tuaries to capture the energy in these flows for hydro-power, but sites with large tidal flows are rare. Two large tidal energy dams are currently operating, one at La Rance on the northern coast of France, and the other in Nova Scotia\u2019s Bay of Fundy.\nFor decades, scientists and engineers have also been \ntrying to produce electricity by tapping wave energy along seacoasts where there are almost continuous waves. Sci-entists estimate that learning how to tap into the world\u2019s wave power at an affordable cost could provide more than twice the amount of electricity that the world uses.\nHowever, production of electricity from tidal and wave \nsystems is limited because of a lack of suitable sites, citizen opposition at some sites, high costs, and equipment dam-age from saltwater corrosion and storms. Proponents hope that improved technology can greatly increase the produc-tion of electricity from tides and waves sometime during this century.\nIn 2014, China was building a pilot plant to evaluate the \nfeasibility of producing electricity by using the difference in temperature between warm surface water and cold deep water in parts of the world\u2019s tropical oceans to generate a flow of electrons. The United States experimented with this approach, called ocean thermal-energy conversion (OTEC) in the 1980s, but abandoned it because of its high cost.Using Wind to Produce Electricity Is an \nImportant Step toward Sustainability\nIn a 2009 study, Harvard University researcher Xi Lu esti-\nmated that wind power (Core Case Study) has the potential to produce 40 times the world\u2019s current use of electricity. Most of the rapidly growing number of wind farms have been built on land in parts of Europe, China, and the United States. However, the frontier for wind energy is offshore wind farms (Figure 13.1) because winds are generally much stronger and steadier over coastal waters than on land.\nSince 1990, wind power has been the world\u2019s second \nfastest-growing source of electricity after solar cells. (See Figure 7, p. S41, in Supplement 5 for a graph showing the rapid exponential growth in electricity production from wind.) In order, the three countries with the largest in-stalled wind power capacity in 2012 were China, the United States, and Germany. In fewer than 10 years, China built the world\u2019s largest wind power capacity and plans to triple it by 2020. However, many of China\u2019s wind farms are in remote areas and produce no electricity be-cause some of the electrical transmission lines for China\u2019s proposed national smart grid have not been built.\nIn 2013, wind farms in more than 85 countries pro-\nduced about 3.5% of the world\u2019s electricity\u2014enough to provide electricity for more than 500 million people, ac-cording to the Earth Policy Institute. By 2050, wind farms could produce about 31% of the world\u2019s electricity, ac-cording to a 2013 analysis by the market research firm iSUPPLi and the Global Wind Energy Council. In 2013, Denmark produced 34% of its electricity using wind power and plans to increase this to 50% by 2020. In 2013, wind provided 50% of Portugal\u2019s electricity, 27% of the electricity used by the U.S. state of Iowa, and 26% of South Dakota\u2019s electricity. By 2013, wind turbines in the United States were producing as much electricity as 60 large nuclear reactors with the capacity of land-based wind turbines increasing 12-fold between 2005 and 2012.

Texas leads the nation in wind energy production, fol-lowed by California, Iowa, and South Dakota.\nEven though offshore wind farms are more costly to \ninstall, analysts expect to see increasing use of them be-cause they can harness stronger winds and thus reduce the cost of producing electricity. When located far enough off-shore they are not visible from the land. Putting them off-shore also lessens the need for negotiations among multiple landowners over the locations of turbines and electrical transmission lines. Japan is installing three of the world\u2019s largest offshore wind turbines. In 2013 the leaders in build-ing offshore wind farms were, in order, Great Britain, Den-mark, Belgium, Germany, China, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Japan.

According to a study by the U.S. Department of the Interior, with expanded and sustained subsidies and a smart grid, wind farms off the Atlantic and Gulf coasts could generate enough electricity to more than replace all of the country\u2019s coal-fired power plants. Many Atlantic and Gulf coast states are making plans to tap into this vast source of energy and create jobs and revenues in the process.\nWind is abundant, widely distributed, and inexhaust-\nible, and wind power is mostly carbon-free and pollution-free. A wind farm can be built within 9 to 12 months and expanded as needed. Although wind farms can cover large areas of land, the turbines occupy only a small total area of land. For each wind turbine located on the land of a farmer or rancher, the landowner typically receives $3,000 to $10,000 a year in royalties, and can still use the land for growing crops or grazing cattle.\nA typical wind turbine can generate enough electricity \nto meet the needs of more than 1,000 homes. An acre of land in northern Iowa planted in corn can produce about $1,000 worth of ethanol car fuel. The same site used for a single wind turbine can produce $300,000 worth of elec-tricity per year, which is why many landowners in favor -\nable wind areas are investing in wind farms.\nIn addition, wind power has a medium-to-high net en-\nergy yield. The DOE and the Worldwatch Institute estimate that, if we were to apply the full-cost pricing principle of sustainability by including the harmful environmental and health costs of various energy resources in compara-tive cost estimates, wind energy would be the least costly way to produce electricity. Between 1990 and 2012, the average cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity from wind power in the United States dropped from 55\u00a2 to 5\u00a2, ac-cording to the U.S. Department of Energy.\nLike any energy source, wind power has some draw-\nbacks. For example, areas with the greatest wind power potential are often sparsely populated and located far from cities. Thus, to take advantage of its huge potential for us-ing wind energy, the United States will have to invest in replacing and expanding its outdated electrical grids with smart grid systems. Another problem is that winds can die down and thus require a backup source of power, such as natural gas, for generating electricity. However, analysts calculate that a large number of wind farms in different areas connected to a smart grid could take up the slack when winds die down in any one area. This could make wind power a very stable and reliable source of electricity, especially if offshore wind farms were included on the grid.\nScientists are working on ways to store wind energy. \nElectricity produced by wind can be passed through water to produce hydrogen fuel, which could be thought of as stored wind power. Another option is to use wind-generated electricity to pump pressurized air deep under -ground into aquifers, caverns, and abandoned natural gas wells. The energy stored in the compressed air could then be released as needed to spin turbines and generate elec-tricity when wind power is not available. Excess electricity from wind farms can also be stored in the millions of hybrid-electric motor vehicles (Figure 13.23) when they are recharging. Together, all these batteries could amount to a gigantic national storage battery.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Bird and Bat Deaths and Wind Turbines\nWildlife ecologists and bird experts have estimated that collisions with wind \nturbines kill as many as 573,000 birds and thousands of bats each year in the United States, although some estimates put the figure at 70,000 to 100,000 birds. \ncompare this to some", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3903, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c7325cf-eff6-447d-ba45-abbaef4af2f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c7325cf-eff6-447d-ba45-abbaef4af2f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "347", "file_name": "G.

Examples are wood, wood wastes, charcoal made from wood, and agricultural wastes (such as sugarcane stalks, rice husks, and corn cobs). Solid biomass is burned mostly for heating and cooking, but also for industrial processes and for generating electricity.\nWood is a renewable fuel only if it is not harvested \nfaster than it is replenished. The problem is that about  \n2.7 billion people in 77 less-developed countries face a fuelwood crisis and are often forced to meet their fuel needs by harvesting wood faster than new vegetation can grow to replace the trees that are removed. One way to deal with this problem is to plant fast-growing trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses in biomass plantations. But repeated cycles of growing and harvesting these plantations can deplete the soil of key nutrients. Also, some plantation tree species such as European poplar and American mes-quite are invasive species and can spread from plantations to take over nearby natural areas.\nAnother problem with depending on solid biomass as \na fuel is that clearing forests and grasslands to provide the fuel reduces biodiversity and the amount of vegetation that would otherwise capture climate-changing CO\n2. At \nthe same time, the burning of wood and other forms of biomass produces CO\n2 and other pollutants such as fine \nparticles in smoke. In 2014, the EPA proposed phasing in stricter regulations to curb such pollution from new resi-dential wood-burning stoves in the United States, begin-ning in 2015. Figure 13.38 lists the general advantages and disadvantages of burning solid biomass as a fuel.\nWe Can Convert Plants and Plant Wastes \nto Liquid Biofuels\nLiquid biofuels such as ethanol (ethyl alcohol produced \nfrom plants and plant wastes) and biodiesel (produced from vegetable oils) are being used increasingly to fuel motor vehicles. The biggest producers of liquid biofuels are, in order, the United States (producing mostly ethanol from corn), Brazil (producing mostly ethanol from sugarcane residues), the European Union (producing mostly bio-diesel from vegetable oils), and China (producing mostly ethanol from non-grain plant sources to avoid diverting grains from its food supply).\nBiofuels have three major advantages over gasoline \nand diesel fuel produced from oil. First, biofuel crops can be grown throughout much of the world, and thus they can help countries to reduce their dependence on im-ported oil. Second, if these crops are not used faster than they are replenished by new plant growth, there is no net increase in CO\n2 emissions, unless existing grasslands or forests are cleared to plant biofuel crops. Third, biofuels are easy to store and transport through existing fuel net-works and can be used in motor vehicles at little addi-tional cost.\nGlobally, ethanol production rose rapidly, especially in \nthe United States and Brazil, between 1975 and 2012 (see the graph in Figure 8, p. S42, in Supplement 5). Brazil makes ethanol from bagasse, a residue produced when sugarcane is crushed. This sugarcane ethanol has a me-dium net energy yield that is about 8 times higher than that of ethanol produced from corn. About 45% of Brazil\u2019s motor vehicles run on ethanol or ethanol\u2013gasoline mix-tures produced from sugarcane grown on only 1% of the country\u2019s arable land.\nIn the United States, most ethanol is made from corn. \nIn 2013, about 43% of the corn produced in the United States was used to produce ethanol.

Plants that could be used for cel-\nlulosic ethanol production are switchgrass, which grows faster than corn, and Arundo donax, a giant reed that yields about three times as much ethanol per acre as corn does. Ecologist David Tilman estimates that the net energy yield for cellulosic ethanol is about 5 times higher than that for corn ethanol.\nAnother approach, being evaluated by scientists at the \nDOE\u2019s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, involves converting a mixture of algae and water to crude oil in less than an hour by subjecting the mixture to high tempera-ture and pressure in a cooker. Learning how to do this on a large scale at an affordable cost and with an acceptable net energy yield will take more research.\nIn a UN report on bioenergy, and in another study by \nR. Zahn and his colleagues, scientists warned that large-scale biofuel crop farming could diminish biodiversity by expanding the clearing of natural forests and grasslands; increase soil degradation, erosion, and nutrient leaching; push small farmers off their land; and raise food prices if food producers can make more money growing corn and other crops to fuel cars than they can raising corn to feed livestock and people.\nRecent studies confirm most of the warnings about us-\ning corn to produce ethanol. For example, in 2013, the Environmental Working Group reported on a study of  \nthe corn-based ethanol program subsidized generously  \nby the U.S. government. The program was judged an eco-logical disaster that has taken more than 2 million hectares (5 million acres) of land out of the soil conservation re-serve, an important topsoil preservation program. It has also led to the filling of wetlands, increased soil erosion, increased contamination of rivers and of the Gulf of \n Mexico (see Figure 11.A, p. 278) with excess fertilizer, and significantly increased CO\n2 emissions.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Biofuels and Climate Change\nNobel Prize\u2013winning chemist Paul crutzen has warned that intensive farming \nof biofuel crops could speed up atmospheric warming and projected climate \nchange by producing more greenhouse gases than would be produced by burning fossil fuels instead of biofuels. This would happen if nitrogen fertilizers were used to grow corn and other biofuel crops. Such fertilizers, when applied to the soil, release large amounts of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. A study by Finn Danielsen and a team of other scientists concluded that keep-ing tropical rain forests intact is a better way to slow projected climate change than burning and clearing such forests and replacing them with biofuel plantations.\nThe challenge is to grow crops for food and biofuels  \nby using more sustainable agriculture (see Figure 10.27,  \np. 242) with less irrigation, land degradation, air and water \npollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and degradation of biodiversity\u2014an important way to increase our beneficial environmental impact. Also, any system for producing a biofuel should have a moderate-to-high net energy yield so that it can compete in the energy marketplace without large government subsidies.\nFigure 13.39 compares the advantages and disadvan-\ntages of using biodiesel and ethanol liquid biofuels.\nWe Can Get Energy by Tapping the Earth\u2019s \nInternal Heat\nGeothermal energy is heat stored in soil, underground \nrocks, and fluids in the earth\u2019s mantle. We can tap into this stored energy to heat and cool buildings and to produce electricity.\nOne way to capture geothermal energy is by using a \ngeothermal heat pump system (Figure 13.40).

This is done by drilling wells into the reservoirs to extract their dry steam (with a low water content), wet steam (with a high water content), or hot water, which are then used to heat homes and buildings, provide hot water, grow vegetables in greenhouses, raise fish in aquaculture ponds, and spin turbines to produce electricity. This source of energy is used in 24 countries and provides about 0.3% of the world\u2019s electricity and a large percentage of the electricity in some countries such as Iceland (36%) and Nicaragua (12%). In Peru, a National Geographic Young Explorer is carrying out research to develop that country\u2019s geothermal resources (Individuals Matter 13.1).\nThe United States is the world\u2019s largest producer of \ngeothermal electricity from hydrothermal reservoirs (see Figure 22, p. S38, in Supplement 4). Most of it is produced in California, Nevada, Utah, and Hawaii. It meets the elec-tricity needs of about 6 million Americans and supplies almost 6% of California\u2019s electricity. Geothermal energy is available around the clock.\nAnother source of geothermal energy is hot, dry rock \nfound 5 or more kilometers (3 or more miles) under -\nground almost everywhere. Water can be injected through wells drilled into this rock. Some of this water, absorbing some of the intense heat, becomes steam that is brought to the surface and used to spin turbines to generate electric-ity. According to the USGS, tapping just 2% of this source of geothermal energy in the United States could produce more than 2,000 times the amount of electricity currently used in the country. The limiting factor is cost, which could be brought down by more research and by improved technology. Some call for the use of geothermal fracking, based on the fracking technology used to produce oil and natural gas (Science Focus 13.1). However, there is con-cern that tapping this deep source of geothermal energy could increase the frequency of earthquakes in the drilled areas. \nGREEN CAREER:  Geothermal engineer\nFigure 13.41 lists the major advantages and disadvan-\ntages of using geothermal energy. The biggest problem limiting the widespread use of geothermal energy is the lack of hydrothermal sites with concentrations of heat high enough to make it affordable.\nWill Hydrogen Save Us?\nSome scientists say that the fuel of the future is hydrogen gas (H\n2). Most of their research has been focused on using \nfuel cells that combine H 2 and oxygen gas (O 2) to produce \nelectricity and water vapor (2 H 2 + O 2 \u2192 2 H 2O + energy), \na harmless chemical that is emitted into the atmosphere.\nWidespread use of hydrogen as a fuel for running mo-\ntor vehicles, heating buildings, and producing electricity would eliminate most of the outdoor air pollution that \nBasement\nheat pump\nGeothermal heating Geothermal cooling\nFIGURE 13.40   Natural capital: A geothermal heat pump system can heat or cool a house almost \nanywhere.\n\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\n90446_ch13_312-357.indd   350 8/13/14   11:05 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Their fieldwork involved lowering temperature-\n \nmeasuring equipment down into abandoned water wells and oil wells in the desert area of northern Peru where daytime temperatures can exceed 54\u00b0C (130\u00b0F). These data will show how heat flows through the upper crust of the earth and how and where this heat can be tapped as a source of energy.\nRuzo believes that geothermal energy is a hidden sleeping giant that can be tapped \nas an important renewable source of heat and electricity. He says that his goal in life is \u201cto be a force of positive change in the world.\u201d\nBackground photo: N.Minton/Shutterstock.com\nSofia Ruzo\ncomes from motor vehicles and coal-burning power and \nindustrial plants. It would also greatly reduce the threat of projected climate change, because in using it, we emit no CO\n2 as long as the H 2 is not produced with the use of fossil \nfuels or nuclear power. Hydrogen also provides more en-ergy per gram than does any other fuel, making it a light-weight fuel ideal for aviation.\nSo what\u2019s the catch? There are three challenges in \nturning the vision of hydrogen as a major fuel into reality. First, there is hardly any hydrogen gas (H\n2) in the earth\u2019s \natmosphere. We can produce H 2 by heating water or pass-\ning electricity through it; by stripping it from the methane (CH\n4) found in natural gas and from gasoline molecules; \nand through a chemical reaction involving coal, oxygen, and steam. As a result, hydrogen has a negative net energy yield because it takes more high-quality energy to produce H\n2 using these methods than we get by burning it.\nSecond, fuel cells are the best way to use H 2 to produce \nelectricity, but current versions of fuel cells are expensive. However, progress in the development of nanotechnology (see Science Focus 12.1, p. 300) could lead to less expen-sive fuel cells.\nThird, whether or not a hydrogen-based energy system \nproduces less outdoor air pollution and CO\n2 than a fossil \nGeothermal Energy\nHigh cost except at \nconcentrated and accessible sources\nScarcity of suitable \nsites\nNoise and some \nCO\n2 emissionsMedium net energy yield and high ef/f_iciency at accessible sites\nLower CO\n2 \nemissions than \nfossil fuels\nLow cost at \nfavorable sitesAdvantages DisadvantagesTrade-Offs\nFIGURE 13.41   Using geothermal energy for space heating and for \nproducing electricity or high-temperature heat for industrial processes \nhas advantages and disadvantages (Concept 13.5).

We \ncould use electricity from coal-burning and nuclear power \nplants to decompose water into H 2 and O 2. But this ap-\nproach does not avoid the harmful environmental effects associated with using coal and the nuclear fuel cycle. Also, making H\n2 from coal or stripping it from methane or gaso-\nline adds much more CO 2 to the atmosphere per unit of heat \ngenerated than does burning the coal or methane directly.\nFor now, hydrogen\u2019s negative net energy yield is a seri-\nous limitation and means that this fuel will have to be subsidized in order for it to compete in the open market-place with fuels that have medium-to-high net energy yields. This could change. In 2011, chemist Daniel Nocera developed an \u201cartificial leaf.\u201d This credit-card-sized silicon wafer produces H\n2 and O 2 when placed in a glass of tap \nwater and exposed to sunlight, and the hydrogen can be extracted and used to power fuel cells. In 2014, a team of researchers led by chemist Tom Meyer developed an elec-trochemical cell that mimics photosynthesis by using the sun\u2019s energy to split water molecules and to produce H\n2 \nfuel. Scaling up either of these processes to produce large amounts of H\n2 at an affordable price with an acceptable \nnet energy yield could represent a tipping point for the future of solar energy and hydrogen that would help im-plement the solar energy principle of sustainability on a global scale.\nFigure 13.42 lists the major advantages and disadvantages \nof using hydrogen as an energy resource. \nGREEN CAREER:  \nHydrogen energy development13.6 HOW CAN WE MAKE THE \nTRANSITION TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE?\nCONCEPT 13.6   We can make the transition to a more sus-\ntainable energy future by greatly improving energy effi-\nciency, using a mix of renewable energy resources, and including the environmental and health costs of energy re-sources in their market prices.\nChoosing Energy Paths\nIn considering possible energy futures, scientists and en-\nergy experts who have evaluated energy alternatives have come to three general conclusions.\nFirst, during this century, there will likely be a gradual shift \nfrom dependence on nonrenewable fossil fuels to a mix of renew-able energy from the sun, wind, flowing water (hydropower), and the earth\u2019s interior (geothermal energy). The use of renewable resources is already enabling many people to depend less on large centralized power systems and more on decen-tralized systems such as rooftop water heaters, single wind turbines, and solar cell panels. Experts also project a shift from gasoline-powered motor vehicles to hybrid and plug-in electric cars and perhaps to all-electric cars, if there are major improvements in battery technology.\nThe second general conclusion of experts about the \nfuture of energy use is that a combination of improved energy efficiency and carefully regulated use of natural gas will be the best way to make the transition to using mostly renewable energy resources during this century (Concept 13.6). However, this will have to include much tighter controls on emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases throughout the en-tire natural gas production and distribution system.\nThe third general conclusion is that because fossil fuels \nare still abundant and artificially cheap, we will continue to use them in large quantities. This presents two major challenges. One is to find ways to reduce the harmful environmental and health impacts of widespread use of fossil fuels, with special emphasis on reducing outdoor air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The second is to find ways to include more of the harmful environmental and health costs of using fossil fuels in their market prices and thus to implement the full-cost pricing principle of sustain-ability.

Making this transition depends primarily on education, \neconomics, and politics\u2014on how well individuals understand environmental and energy problems and their possible so-lutions, and on how they vote and then influence their elected officials. People can also vote with their pocketbooks by refusing to buy energy-inefficient and environmentally harmful products and services, and by letting company ex-ecutives and elected officials know about their choices.\nFigure 13.44 lists some ways in which you can take \npart in the transition to a more environmentally and eco-nomically sustainable energy future.\n90446_ch13_312-357.indd   353 8/13/14   11:05 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

We have also looked at the advan-tages and disadvantages of an array of nonrenewable and renewable energy resources.\nBy relying mostly on nonrenewable \n fossil fuels, we violate \nthe three scientific principles of sustainability (see  \nSupplement 7, p. S50). The technologies we use to  \nobtain energy from these resources disrupt the earth\u2019s chemi-cal cycles by diverting huge amounts of water, degrading or destroying terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and emitting large quantities of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. Using these technologies also destroys and degrades biodiver -\nsity and ecosystem services.\nBy relying more on a diversity of direct and indirect forms \nof renewable solar energy and by greatly improving energy ef-ficiency, we could implement the three scientific principles of sustainability during this century and greatly increase our beneficial environmental impact. Making this shift would also follow the three social science principles of sustainability (see Supplement 7, p. S51). By including the harmful environ-mental and health costs of fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and other energy resources in their market prices, we would be applying the full-cost pricing principle. This could be accom-plished with the aid of compromise and trade-offs in the po-litical arena by applying the win-win solutions principle. And many analysts argue that such solutions would greatly benefit life on earth immediately and in the long run\u2014a classic  \napplication of the ethical principle of responsibility to current and future generations.TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nWind Power and Sustainability\nUlrich Mueller/Shutterstock.com\nand in the United States?

How are most of the buildings heated? How is water heated? How are most of the vehicles powered? How is the computer network powered? How could energy effi-ciency be improved, if at all, in each of these areas? If it does not already do so, how could your school make use of solar, wind, biomass, and other forms of renewable en-ergy? Write up a proposal for using energy more effi-ciently and sustainably at your school and submit it to school officials.Critical Thinking\n 1. Suppose that a developer has proposed building a wind farm near where you live (Core Case Study). Would you be in favor of the project or opposed to it? Write a letter to your local newspaper or a blog for a website explaining your position and your rea-soning. Include the concept of net energy yield in your arguments. As part of your research, determine how the electricity you use now is generated and where the power plant is located, and include this informa-tion in your arguments.\n 2. Should governments give a high priority to consider -\ning net energy yields when deciding what energy re-sources to support? What are other factors that should be considered? Which factor or factors should get the most weight in decision making? Explain your thinking.\n 3. Some analysts argue that in order to continue using oil at the current rate, we must discover and add to global oil reserves the equivalent of two new Saudi Arabian reserves every 7 years. Do you think this is possible? If not, what effects might the failure to find such supplies have on your life and on the lives of any children and grandchildren that you might even-tually have?\n 4. During much of the time since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the United States and Euro-pean nations fueled their economic growth by burn-ing coal, with little effort to control the resulting air pollution. Eventually, as they became more affluent, they established air pollution standards and sought cleaner energy sources. Now China, which has been fueling its rapid economic growth largely by burning coal, says it is being asked to shift to cleaner energy resources before it becomes affluent enough to do so, even though most countries have not made such a shift. Do you think this is a fair expectation? Explain.\n 5. List five ways in which you unnecessarily waste en-ergy during a typical day, and explain how these ac-tions violate each of the three scientific princi- ples of sustainability.\n 6. What do you think should be the top three energy resources? Explain. What do you think should be the three least-used energy resources? Explain.\n 7. Explain why you would support or oppose each of the following proposals made by various energy analysts:\n a. Government subsidies for all energy alternatives should be eliminated so that all energy choices can compete on a level playing field in the marketplace.\n b. All government tax breaks and other subsidies for conventional fossil fuels, synthetic natural gas and oil, and nuclear power (fission and fusion) should be eliminated. They should be replaced with subsidies and tax breaks for improving en-ergy efficiency and developing renewable energy resources.\n c. Development of renewable energy resources should be left to private enterprise and should re-ceive little or no help from the federal govern-ment, but the nuclear power and fossil fuels industries should continue to receive large fed-eral government subsidies and tax breaks.\n 8. Congratulations! You are in charge of the world.

Research \nindicates that long-term exposure to high levels of mercury can perma-nently damage the human nervous system, brain, kidneys, and lungs. Fairly low levels of mercury can also harm fetuses and cause birth defects. Pregnant women, nursing mothers and their babies, women of childbear -\ning age, and young children are espe-cially vulnerable to the harmful effects of mercury.\nThis toxic metal is released into the \nair from rocks, soil, and volcanoes and by vaporization from the oceans. Such natural sources account for about one-third of the mercury reaching the atmosphere each year. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.N. Environ-ment Programme (UNEP), the remain-ing two-thirds come from human activities. The largest source of mer -\ncury air pollution is the millions of small-scale gold miners in Africa, Latin America, and Asia who use mercury to separate gold from its ore and then heat the mixture of gold and mercury to release the gold (see Case Study,  p. 299). The second largest input of mercury into the atmosphere comes from the smokestacks of coal-burning power and industrial plants (chapter-opening photo), cement kilns, smelt-ers, and solid-waste incinerators.\nBecause mercury is an element, it \ncannot be broken down or degraded. Therefore, this indestructible global pollutant can accumulate in soil, in water, and in the tissues of humans and other animals. In the atmosphere, some elemental mercury is converted to more toxic inorganic and organic mercury compounds that can be deposited in lakes and other aquatic environments and on land. Under cer -\ntain conditions in aquatic systems, bacteria can convert inorganic mercury compounds to highly toxic methylmer -\ncury (CH\n3Hg+). These compounds are \ntypically deposited from the air or dumped into streams by small-scale gold miners. Like DDT (see Figure 8.9, p. 171), methylmercury can be biologi-cally magnified in food chains and food webs, and high levels of methyl-mercury are often found in the tissues of large fishes\u2014such as tuna, sword-fish, shark, and marlin\u2014that feed at \nhigh trophic levels in aquatic systems. Shrimp and salmon generally have low levels of mercury.\nHumans are exposed to mercury in \ntwo major ways. First, we eat fish and shellfish that are contaminated with methylmercury (Figure 14.1). Second,  \nwe inhale vaporized elemental mer -\ncury or particles of inorganic mercury salts in the air.\nThe greatest risk from exposure to \nlow levels of methylmercury is that of brain damage in fetuses and young children. Studies estimate that 30,000\u201360,000 of the children born each year in the United States are likely to have reduced IQs and possible nervous system damage because of such exposure.\nThis problem raises two important \nquestions: How do scientists deter -\nmine the potential harm from expo-sure to mercury and other chemicals? And how serious is the risk of harm from a particular chemical compared to other risks?\nIn this chapter, we will look at \nhow scientists try to answer these and other questions about our exposure to chemicals. We will also examine health threats from disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and from other hazards that kill millions of people every year.Mercury\u2019s Toxic Effects\n360 FIGURE 14.1   This fish (left) is contaminated \nwith mercury, as are the fish in many lakes, in-\ncluding this one in Wisconsin (right).\nLeft: Peter Casolino/Alamy; Right: Drake Fleege/Alamy\n90446_ch14_358-385.indd   360", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3557, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "347dc14b-3477-4172-92d5-35598224144e": {"__data__": {"id_": "347dc14b-3477-4172-92d5-35598224144e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "360", "file_name": "G.

Scientists often state a probability in terms such as, \u201cThe lifetime probability of developing lung cancer from smoking one pack of cigarettes per day is 1 in 250.\u201d This means that 1 of every 250 people who smoke a pack of cigarettes every day will likely develop lung cancer over a typical lifetime (usually considered to be 70 years). Probability can also be expressed as a percentage, as in a 30% chance of rain.\nRisk assessment is the process of using statistical \nmethods to estimate how much harm a particular hazard can cause to human health or to the environment. Risk management involves deciding whether and how to \n reduce a particular risk to a certain level and at what  \ncost. Figure 14.2 summarizes how risks are assessed and managed.\nWe can suffer harm from five major types of hazards \n(Concept 14.1):\n\u2022\tBiological hazards from more than 1,400 pathogens, or \norganisms that can cause disease in other organisms. Examples are bacteria, viruses, parasites, protozoa, and fungi.\n\u2022\tChemical hazards from harmful chemicals in our air, water, soil, food, and human-made products (Core Case Study).\u2022\tNatural hazards such as fire, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and storms.\n\u2022\tCultural hazards such as unsafe working conditions, criminal assault, and poverty.\n\u2022\tLifestyle choices such as smoking, making poor food choices, and having unsafe sex.\n14.2 WHAT TYPES OF BIOLOGICAL \nHAZARDS DO WE FACE?\nCONCEPT 14.2   The most serious biological hazards we \nface are infectious diseases such as flu, AIDS, tuberculosis, \ndiarrheal diseases, and malaria.\nSome Diseases Can Spread from One \nPerson to Another\nAn infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen \nsuch as a bacterium, virus, or parasite invading the body \nand multiplying in its cells and tissues. Bacteria are single-cell organisms that are found everywhere and that can multiply very rapidly on their own. Most bacteria are harmless or beneficial but some cause diseases such as strep throat and tuberculosis (see Case Study that follows). Vi -\nruses are pathogens that are smaller than bacteria and work by invading a cell and taking over its genetic machin-ery to copy themselves and then spreading throughout a body. They cause diseases such as flu and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Parasites, organisms that live on or inside other organisms and feed on them, can also cause serious infectious diseases, including malaria.\nA transmissible disease is an infectious disease that \ncan be transmitted from one person to another. Some are bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis and gonorrhea. Oth-ers are viral diseases such as the common cold, flu, and AIDS. A nontransmissible disease is caused by some-thing other than a living organism and does not spread from one person to another. Such diseases include cardio-vascular (heart and blood vessel) diseases, most cancers, asthma, and diabetes.\nIn 1900, infectious disease was the leading cause of \ndeath in the world. Since then, and especially since 1950, the incidences of infectious diseases and the death rates from them have been greatly reduced. This has been achieved mostly by a combination of better health care, the use of antibiotics to treat diseases caused by bac-teria, and the development of vaccines to prevent the spread of some viral", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3658, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8178420b-e594-4763-ad8a-d60e58d21c0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8178420b-e594-4763-ad8a-d60e58d21c0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "361", "file_name": "G.

A global epidemic \nsuch as tuberculosis or AIDS is called a pandemic. Figure 14.3 shows the annual death tolls from the world\u2019s seven deadliest infectious diseases (Concept 14.2).\nOne reason why infectious disease is still a serious \nthreat is that many disease-carrying bacteria have devel-oped genetic immunity to widely used antibiotics (Science Focus 14.1). Also, many disease-transmitting species of insects such as mosquitoes have become immune to widely used pesticides such as DDT that once helped to control their populations.\nCASE STUDY\nThe Global Threat from Tuberculosis\nSince 1990, one of the world\u2019s most underreported stories has been the spread of tuberculosis (TB), an extremely contagious bacterial infection of the lungs. Many TB-infected people do not appear to be sick, and most of them do not know they are infected. Left untreated, each person with active TB typically infects a number of other people. Without treatment, about half of the people with active TB \nAntibiotics are chemicals that can kill \nbacteria. They have played an impor -\ntant role in the 30-year increase in \nAmerican life expectancy since 1950.\nIn 2014, the World Health Organi-\nzation issued a report warning that the age of antibiotics may be coming to an end, because disease-causing bacteria are becoming genetically resistant to the antibiotics that we have long used to fight infectious diseases such as ear infections, bloodstream infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, di-arrhea, and gonorrhea. We are falling behind in our efforts to prevent infec-tious bacterial diseases because of the astounding reproductive rate of bacte-ria, some of which can grow from a population of 1 to well over 16 million in 24 hours. This allows bacteria to quickly become genetically resistant to an increasing number of antibiotics through natural selection (see Figure 4.9, p. 74).\nOther factors can promote such ge-\nnetic resistance to antibiotics. One is the spread of bacteria around the globe by human travel and interna-tional trade. Another is the overuse of pesticides, which leads to growing populations of pesticide-resistant in-sects and other carriers of bacterial dis-eases. In addition, some drug-resistant bacteria can quickly transfer their resis-tance to nonresistant bacteria by ex-changing genetic material.\nYet another factor is the overuse of \nantibiotics for colds, flu, and sore throats, most of which are viral diseases that cannot be treated with antibiotics. \nGENETIC RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS IS INCREASING\nIn many countries, antibiotics are avail-able without a prescription, which pro-motes excessive and unnecessary use. Also, the growing use of antibacterial hand soaps and other antibacterial cleansers could be promoting antibiotic resistance in bacteria.\nBacterial resistance to some antibi-\notics has also increased because these drugs are widely used to control dis-ease and to promote growth among dairy and beef cattle, poultry, hogs, and other livestock that are raised in large numbers in crowded conditions. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA) estimated that about 80% of all antibiotics used in the United States and 50% of those used worldwide are added to the feed of healthy livestock. The FDA found that ScienceFocus14.1\n3.2 millionDisease\n(type of agent)Deaths per year\nPneumonia and /f_lu\n(bacteria and viruses)\n1.6 millionHIV/AIDS\n(virus)\n660,000\n600,000760,000\nMalaria\n(protozoa)Diarrheal diseases\n(bacteria and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3628, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71225cb7-063a-4fcb-a0bb-4dad85da8686": {"__data__": {"id_": "71225cb7-063a-4fcb-a0bb-4dad85da8686", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "362", "file_name": "G.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB strikes about 8.6 million people per year and kills 1.3 million. More than 95% of these deaths occur in less-developed countries, led (in order) by India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\nSeveral factors account for the spread of TB since 1990. \nOne is a lack of TB screening and control programs, espe-cially in less-developed countries, where 95% of the new cases occur. However, researchers are developing new and easier ways to detect TB in its victims and to monitor vic-tims for loss of liver function as a possible side effect of taking anti-TB drugs (Individuals Matter 14.1).\nA second problem is that most strains of the TB bacte-\nrium have developed genetic resistance to the majority of the effective antibiotics. Also, population growth, urban-ization, and air travel have greatly increased person-to-person contacts, and TB is spreading faster in areas where large numbers of poor people crowd together, especially in the rapidly growing slums of less-developed countries. A person with active TB might infect several people during a single bus or plane ride.\nSlowing the spread of the disease requires early identi-\nfication and treatment of people with active TB, especially those with a chronic cough, which is the primary way in which the disease is spread from person to person. Treat-ment with a combination of four inexpensive drugs can cure 90% of individuals with active TB. To be effective, the drugs must be taken every day for 6\u20139 months. Because the symptoms disappear after a few weeks, many patients, thinking they are cured, stop taking the drugs, allowing the disease to recur, possibly in drug-resistant forms, and to spread to other people.\nIn recent years, a deadly and apparently incurable \nform of tuberculosis, known as multidrug-resistant TB, has been spreading, especially in India, China, and Russia, and killing about 150,000 people a year. Because this disease cannot be treated effectively with antibiotics, victims must be permanently isolated from the rest of society, and they pose a threat to health workers.\nViral Diseases and Parasites Kill Large \nNumbers of People\nViruses are not affected by antibiotics and can be very \ndeadly. The biggest viral killer is the influenza or flu virus (Concept 14.2), which is transmitted by the body fluids or airborne emissions of an infected person and often leads to \n18 of 30 antibiotics used on livestock \nbetween 2001 and 2010 posed a high risk to human health through exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food.\nAs a result of these factors acting to-\ngether, every major disease-causing bac-terium has now developed strains that resist at least 1 of the roughly 200 anti-biotics used to treat bacterial infections, and a growing number of bacteria have developed genetic resistance to more than one antibiotic. We are now seeing the emergence of superbugs, bacteria that resist all available antibiotics. In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that each year, at least 2 million Americans get infectious diseases from superbugs, and at least 23,000 die. Also, 1 of ev-ery 25 U.S. hospital patients picks up such an infection while in the hospital.\nFor example, a bacterium known as \nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as MRSA (or \u201cmersa\u201d), has become resistant to most common antibiotics. This type of staph infection first appears on the skin as a red, swollen, and sometimes-painful pimple or boil that will not heal. MRSA can cause a vicious type of pneumonia, flesh-eating wounds, and a quick death if it gets into the blood-stream.

No major new anti-biotics have been developed in recent years, mostly because drug companies lose millions of dollars developing new antibiotics that are used for only a short time to treat various infections, compared to more profitable drugs that users take daily for chronic health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure.\nResearchers are evaluating the use \nof trace amounts of silver to boost an antibiotic\u2019s power. They are also using computer analysis to look for gene pat-terns in microbes that could be used to develop new antibiotics. Researchers are also looking for ways reduce the ability of germs to cause infections by disrupting the chemical signals they use to release a toxin or to attack.\nCritical Thinking\nWhat are three steps that you think we could take to slow the rate at which disease-causing bacteria are developing resistance to antibiotics?\n90446_ch14_358-385.indd   363 8/13/14   11:06 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Flu viruses are so easily transmitted that \nan especially potent flu virus could spread around the world in a pandemic that could kill millions of people in only a few months.\nThe second biggest viral killer is the human immunodefi-\nciency virus, or HIV (see the following Case Study). On a global scale, according to the WHO, HIV infects about 2.5 million people every year, and the complications resulting from AIDS kill about 1.6 million people annually. HIV is transmitted by unsafe sex, the sharing of needles by drug users, infected mothers who pass the virus to their offspring before or during birth, and exposure to infected blood.\nThe third largest viral killer is the hepatitis B virus (HBV), \nwhich damages the liver. According to the WHO, it kills about 600,000 people each year. It is spread in the same ways that HIV is spread.\nScientists estimate that throughout history, more than \nhalf of all infectious diseases were originally transmitted to humans from wild or domesticated animals. The West Nile virus (which is transmitted by a mosquito bite and has killed more than 1,500 Americans since 2012), HIV, and a flu strain from birds, called avian flu, all fall in this cate-gory. The development of such diseases has spurred the growth of the relatively new field of ecological medicine\u2014devoted to tracking down disease connections between animals and humans.

Wash your hands thoroughly (for at least 20 seconds) and frequently with plain soap, avoid sharing personal items such as razors or towels, keep all cuts and scrapes covered with bandages until healed, stay away from people who have flu or other viral diseases, and try not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.\nYet another growing health hazard is infectious dis-\neases caused by parasites, especially malaria (see the sec-ond Case Study that follows).\nCASE STUDY\nThe Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic\nThe global spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by infection with HIV, is a major global health threat. This virus cripples the immune system and leaves the body vulnerable to infections such as tubercu-losis (TB) and rare forms of cancer such as Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. A person infected with HIV can live a normal life, but if the infection develops into AIDS, death is likely.\nHayat Sindi: Science Entrepreneur and National Geographic \nEmerging Explorer\nGrowing up in a home of humble means in Saudi Arabia, Hayat Sindi was determined to \nget an education, become a scientist, and do something for humanity. She was the first Saudi woman to be accepted at Cambridge University. She earned a PhD and taught in the Cambridge\u2019s international medical program, and in 2012, she was named a National Geo-graphic Emerging Explorer.\nAs a visiting scholar, Sindi worked with a team of scientists at Harvard University to co-\nfound a nonprofit marketing company called \nDiagnostics for All  to bring low-cost health \nmonitoring to remote, poor areas of the world. The Harvard team had developed an inex-pensive diagnostic tool that can be used to detect certain illnesses and medical problems, such as declining liver function. It is a piece of paper the size of a postage stamp, with tiny channels and wells etched into it. Technicians load the paper with certain chemicals and then put a drop of a patient\u2019s blood, urine, or saliva onto this paper where the chemicals react with the fluid to change its color. The colors can be read with the aid of a color scale \nthat indicates different sorts of infections and conditions such as declining liver function. The test takes less than a minute, can be conducted by a technician with minimal training, and requires no electricity, clean water, or special equipment. After the paper-testing tool is used, it can be burned on the spot to prevent the spread of any infectious agents.\nSindi has also launched a nonprofit foundation known as the \nInstitute for Imagination and Ingenuity  to help young people in \npoor areas of the world to do what she did. It will give funding and guidance to those who wish to attend a university and then return to their home countries to use their talents in helping others.\nBackground photo: Antonprado/iStockphoto.com\nHAYAT SINDIindividuals matter 14.1 \n90446_ch14_358-385.indd   365 8/13/14   11:06 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3777, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82f8f362-5801-40fb-94a9-04f12b7e8a31": {"__data__": {"id_": "82f8f362-5801-40fb-94a9-04f12b7e8a31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "365", "file_name": "G.

According to the WHO, in \n2012, a total of about 35.3 million people worldwide (about 1.1 million in the United States) were living with HIV. In 2012, there were about 2.3 million new cases of AIDS (about 32,000 in the United States)\u2014half of them in people aged 15 to 24. This is down from an esti-mated 3.2 million new cases in 1997.\nThe treatment for an HIV infection includes a combi-\nnation of antiviral drugs that can slow the progress of the virus. However, such drugs cost too much to be used widely in the less-developed countries where AIDS infec-tions are widespread. Also, this treatment can result in a loss of liver function in a victim (Individuals Matter 14.1). It is estimated that about one of every five people infected with HIV is not aware of the infection and can spread the virus for years.\nBetween 1981 and 2012, more than 36 million people \n(636,000 in the United States) died of AIDS-related dis-eases, according to the CDC. Each year, AIDS kills about 1.6 million people (about 15,500 in the United States)\u2014down from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005. AIDS has reduced the life expectancy of the 750 million people living in sub-Saharan Africa from 62 to 47 years, on average, and to 40 years in the seven countries most severely affected by AIDS.\nWorldwide, AIDS is the leading cause of death for peo-\nple of ages 15\u201349. This affects the population age structures in several African countries, including Botswana (Figure 14.5), where, in 2012, 23% of all people between ages 15 and 49 were infected with HIV, mostly from heterosexual contact. The premature deaths of many teachers, health-care workers, farmers, and other young, productive adults has also contributed to declining education, health care, food production, economic development, and political sta-bility in these countries, along with the disintegration of many families and a large number of orphaned children.\nCASE STUDY\nMalaria\u2014The Spread of a Deadly Parasite\nAlmost half of the world\u2019s people\u2014most of them living in poor African countries\u2014are at risk of getting malaria (Fig-ure 14.6). So is anyone traveling to malaria-prone areas, because there is no vaccine that can prevent this disease.\nMalaria is caused by a parasite that is spread by certain \nmosquito species. The parasite infects and destroys its vic-tim\u2019s red blood cells, causing intense fever, chills, drench-ing sweats, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, headaches, and increased susceptibility to other diseases. According to the WHO, malaria kills about 660,000 people a year. How-ever, some experts contend this total could be as high as 1.2 million, because public health records are incomplete in many areas. More than 90% of all malaria victims live in sub-Saharan Africa, the area south of the Sahara Desert, \nAge\n120 40 100 80 60 20 60 02040 120 80 100\nPopulation (thousands)Males Females100+\n95\u201399\n90\u20139485\u20138980\u20138475\u20137970\u20137465\u20136960\u20136455\u20135950\u20135445\u20134940\u20134435\u20133930\u20133425\u20132920\u20132415\u20131910\u201314\n5\u201390\u20134\nWith AIDS Without AIDS\nFIGURE 14.5   In Botswana, more than 25% of people ages 15\u201349 \nwere infected with HIV in 2011.

Many \nof the children who survive suffer brain damage or im-paired learning ability.\nFour species of protozoan parasites in the genus Plas-\nmodium cause malaria. The cycle of infection begins when an uninfected female of any of about 60 Anopheles mos-quito species bites a person (usually at night) who is in-fected with the Plasmodium parasite, ingests blood that contains the parasite, and later bites an uninfected person. The parasites then move out of the mosquito and into the human\u2019s bloodstream and liver, where they multiply. Ma-laria can also be transmitted by contaminated blood trans-fusions and by drug users sharing needles.\nOver the course of human history, malarial protozoa probably \nhave killed more people than all the wars ever fought. During the 1950s and 1960s, the spread of malaria was slowed when the swamplands and marshes where mosquitoes breed were drained or sprayed with insecticides, and drugs were used to kill the parasites in victims\u2019 bloodstreams. Since 1970, however, malaria has come roaring back. Most species of the Anopheles mosquito have become genetically resistant to most insecticides and the Plasmodium parasites have become genetically resistant to common antimalarial drugs.

Another approach is to provide poor people in malarial regions with free or inexpensive insecticide-treated bed nets (Figure 14.7) and window screens. Also, zinc and vitamin A supplements could be given to children to boost their resistance to malaria. In addition, we can greatly reduce the incidence of malaria at a low cost by spraying the insides of homes with low con-centrations of the pesticide DDT twice a year. While DDT is being phased out in most countries, the WHO supports limited use of DDT for malaria control. In 2014, research-ers developed a rapid laser pulse test for malaria that elimi-nates the need to draw blood. It takes only 20 seconds at half the cost of the conventional test, and because no blood is withdrawn, it cuts the risk of infection.\nWe Can Reduce the Incidence of Infectious \nDiseases\nAccording to the WHO, the percentage of all deaths world-\nwide resulting from infectious diseases dropped from 35% to 15% between 1970 and 2010, primarily because a GOOD\nNEWSgrowing number of children were immunized against the \nmajor infectious diseases. Between 1990 and 2010, the estimated annual number of children younger than age 5 who died from infectious diseases dropped from nearly 12 million to 4.4 million.\nFigure 14.8 lists measures promoted by health scien-\ntists and public health officials to help prevent or reduce the incidence of infectious diseases\u2014especially in less-developed countries. An important breakthrough has been the development of simple oral rehydration therapy to help prevent death from dehydration for victims of severe diarrhea, which causes about one-fourth of all deaths of children younger than age 5. This therapy involves admin-istering a simple solution of boiled water, salt, and sugar or rice at a cost of only a few cents per person. \nGREEN CAREER:  \nInfectious disease prevention\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Drinking Water, Latrines, and Infectious \nDiseases\nMore than a third of the world\u2019s people\u20142.6 billion\u2014do not have sanitary \nbathroom facilities, and more than 1 billion get their water for drinking, wash-ing, and cooking from sources polluted by animal or human feces.

Examples of carcinogens are arsenic, benzene, formaldehyde, gamma radiation, PCBs, radon, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, vinyl chloride, and certain chemicals in tobacco smoke.\nTypically, 10\u201340 years may elapse between the initial \nexposure to a carcinogen and the appearance of detectable cancer symptoms. Partly because of this time lag, many healthy teenagers and young adults have trouble believing that their smoking, drinking, eating, and other habits today could lead to some form of cancer before they reach age 50.\nThe second major type of toxic agent, mutagens, in-\ncludes chemicals or forms of radiation that cause or in-crease the frequency of mutations, or changes, in the DNA molecules found in cells. Most mutations cause no harm, but some can lead to cancers and other disorders. For ex-ample, nitrous acid (HNO\n2), formed by the digestion of ni-\ntrite (NO 2\u2212) preservatives in foods, can cause mutations \nlinked to increases in stomach cancer in people who con-sume large amounts of processed foods and wine contain-ing such preservatives. Harmful mutations occurring in reproductive cells can be passed on to offspring and to fu-ture generations.\nTeratogens, a third type of toxic agent, are chemicals \nthat harm or cause birth defects in a fetus or embryo. Ethyl alcohol is a teratogen. Women who drink during preg-nancy increase their risk of having babies with low birth weight and a number of physical, developmental, behav-ioral, and mental problems. Other teratogens are angel dust, benzene, formaldehyde, lead, mercury (Core Case Study), PCBs, phthalates, thalidomide, and vinyl chloride. (We discuss some of these hazardous chemicals further on in this chapter.)Some Chemicals Can Affect Important \nBody Systems\nSince the 1970s, research on wildlife and laboratory ani-\nmals along with some studies of humans suggest that long-term exposure to some chemicals in the environment can disrupt important body systems, including immune and nervous systems (Concept 14.3).\nThe immune system consists of specialized cells and tis-\nsues that protect the body against disease and harmful substances by forming antibodies, or specialized proteins that render invading agents harmless. Some chemicals such as arsenic, methylmercury (Core Case Study), and di-oxins can weaken the human immune system and leave the body vulnerable to attacks by allergens and infectious bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.\nSome natural and synthetic chemicals in the environ-\nment, called neurotoxins, can harm the human nervous sys-tem (brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves). Effects can include behavioral changes, learning disabilities, attention-deficit disorder, paralysis, and death. Examples of neuro-toxins are PCBs,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3701, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cd0c275-7fbc-49ca-86ab-d35ea6ffa1fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cd0c275-7fbc-49ca-86ab-d35ea6ffa1fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "369", "file_name": "G.

Examples of neuro-toxins are PCBs, arsenic, lead, and certain pesticides.\nMethylmercury (Core Case Study) is an especially dan-\ngerous neurotoxin because it is persists in the environment and, like DDT, can be biologically magnified in food chains and food webs (Figure 8.9, p. 171).\n According to the Natu-\nral Resources Defense Council, predatory fish such as tuna, marlin, orange roughy, swordfish, mackerel, Chilean sea bass, grouper, and sharks can have mercury concentrations in their bodies that are 10,000 times higher than the levels in the water around them. A 2009 EPA study found that almost half of the fish tested in 500 lakes and reservoirs across the United States had levels of mercury that ex-ceeded safe levels (Figure 14.1). Similarly, a 2009 study by the U.S. Geological Survey of nearly 300 streams across the United States found mercury-contaminated fish in all of the streams surveyed, with one-fourth of the fish exceed-ing the safe levels determined by the EPA.\nThe symptoms of mercury poisoning in adults include \npoor balance and coordination, muscle weakness, trem-ors, memory problems, insomnia, hearing loss, loss of hair, and loss of peripheral vision. The EPA estimates that about 1 of every 12 women of childbearing age in the United States has enough mercury in her blood to harm a developing fetus. Figure 14.9 lists ways to prevent or re-duce human inputs of mercury (Core Case Study) into the environment.\nSome Chemicals Affect the Human \nEndocrine System\nThe endocrine system is a complex network of glands that \nrelease tiny amounts of hormones into the bloodstreams of \nhumans and other vertebrate animals.

Each type of hormone has a unique molecular shape that allows it to attach to certain parts of cells called receptors, and to transmit its chemical \nmessage.\nMolecules of certain pesticides and other synthetic \nchemicals such as bisphenol A, or BPA (Science Focus 14.2), \nhave shapes similar to those of natural hormones. This allows them to attach to the molecules of natural hor -\nmones and to disrupt the endocrine systems in humans and in some other animals (Concept 14.3). These mole-cules are called hormonally active agents (HAAs) or endocrine \ndisruptors.\nExamples of HAAs include Atrazine\u2122 and several \nother widely used herbicides, organophosphate pesticides, dioxins, lead, mercury (Core Case Study), phthalates, vari-ous fire retardants, and BPA. Some HAAs, including BPA and bisphenol S (BPS), act as hormone imposters, or hor-mone mimics. They are chemically similar to estrogens (fe-male sex hormones) and can disrupt the endocrine system by attaching to estrogen receptor molecules. Other HAAs, called hormone blockers, disrupt the endocrine system by \npreventing natural hormones such as androgens (male sex hormones) from attaching to their receptors.\nThe estrogen mimic bisphenol A (BPA)  \nserves as a hardening agent in certain \nplastics (especially shatter-proof poly-carbonate) that are used in a variety of products, including some baby bottles, sipping cups, and pacifiers, as well as some reusable water bottles, sports drink and juice bottles, microwave dishes, and food storage containers. BPA is also used to make some dental sealants, as well as the plastic resins that line nearly all food and soft drink cans and cans holding baby formulas and foods. This type of liner allows containers to withstand extreme tem-peratures, keeps canned food from in-teracting with the metal in the cans, prevents rust in the cans, and helps to preserve the canned food. In addition, individuals can be exposed to BPA when their hands touch the thermal paper used to produce some cash reg-ister receipts.\nA study by the CDC indicated that \n93% of Americans older than age 6 had trace levels of BPA in their urine. While these levels were well below the acceptable level set by the EPA, the EPA level was established in the late 1980s, long before we knew much about the potential effects of BPA on human health. The CDC study also found that children and adolescents had generally higher urinary BPA levels than adults had.\nTHE CONTROVERSY OVER BPA\nResearch indicates that the BPA in \nplastics can leach into water or food when the plastic is heated to high tem-peratures, microwaved, or exposed to acidic liquids. A 2009 Harvard Univer -\nsity Medical School study found that there was a 66% increase in BPA levels in the urine of participants who drank from polycarbonate bottles regularly for just 1 week.\nBy 2013, more than 90 published \nstudies by independent laboratories had found a number of significant ad-verse effects on test animals from ex-posure to very low levels of BPA. These effects include brain damage, early pu-berty, decreased sperm quality, certain ScienceFocus14.2\nFIGURE 14.9   Some ways to prevent or control inputs of mercury \n(Core Case Study) into the environment from human sources\u2014mostly \ncoal-burning power plants and incinerators.

The FDA also said that there is no evi-dence that using these chemicals is any more effective in preventing bacterial infections than is thoroughly washing your hands with plain soap and water. Since 2000, several European countries have restricted the use of triclosan in consumer products.\nThere is growing concern about another group of \nHAAs\u2014pollutants that can act as thyroid disrupters and cause growth, weight, brain, and behavioral disorders. Scientists are also increasingly concerned about certain HAAs called phthalates (pronounced THALL-eights). These chemicals are used to make plastics more flexible and to make cosmetics easier to apply to the skin. They are found in a variety of products, including many detergents, per -\nfumes, cosmetics, baby powders, body lotions for adults and babies, sunscreens, hair sprays, deodorants, soaps, nail polishes, shampoos for adults and babies, and the coatings on many timed-release drugs. They are also found in poly-vinyl chloride (PVC) plastic products such as soft vinyl toys, teething rings, blood storage bags, intravenous drip bags, medical tubing, shower curtains, and some plastic \ncancers, heart disease, obesity, liver \ndamage, impaired immune function, type 2 diabetes, hyperactivity, impaired learning, impotence in males, and obe-sity in unborn test animals exposed to BPA. On the other hand, 12 studies funded by the chemical industry found no evidence or only weak evidence of adverse effects from low-level exposure to BPA in test animals.\nIn the face of these conflicting and \npossibly confusing research findings, consumers now have more choices, since most makers of baby bottles, sip-ping cups, and sports water bottles of-fer BPA-free alternatives. Also, many consumers are avoiding plastic contain-ers with a #7 recycling code (which in-dicates that BPA can be present). People are also using powdered infant formula instead of liquid formula from metal cans, choosing glass bottles and food containers instead of those made of plastic or lined with plastic resins, and using glass, ceramic, or stainless steel coffee mugs rather than plastic cups.\nMany manufacturers have replaced \nBPA with bisphenol-S (BPS). However, studies indicate that BPS can have ef-fects similar to those of BPA, and BPS is now showing up in human urine at levels similar those of BPA. There are substitutes for the plastic resins con-taining BPA or BPS that line 90% of the food cans used in the United States. However, these replacements are more expensive, and the potential health effects of some chemicals they contain also need to be evaluated. Some companies, including Campbell Soup and H.J. Heinz, are phasing out the use of BPA in can liners.\nCanada, the European Union, and \nsix states have banned the sale of plas-tic baby bottles that contain BPA. In 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-istration (FDA) concluded that BPA in food and drink containers was not a health hazard. However, in 2012, the FDA, while not reversing its general position, banned the use of BPA in baby bottles and sipping cups.\nCritical Thinking\nShould plastics that contain BPA or BPS be banned from use in all children\u2019s products?

They call for more research to justify any restrictions on HAAs that would cause economic losses for the companies that make them.\nConcerns about BPA, phthalates, and other HAAs \nhighlight the difficulty of assessing the possible harmful health effects resulting from exposure to very low levels of various chemicals. Resolving these uncertainties will take decades of research. Some scientists argue that as a pre-caution during this period of research, we should sharply reduce our use of potentially harmful hormone disrupters, especially in products frequently used by pregnant women, infants, young children, and teenagers (Figure 14.10).\n14.4 HOW CAN WE EVALUATE \nCHEMICAL HAZARDS?\nCONCEPT 14.4A   Scientists use live laboratory animals, \ncase reports of poisonings, and epidemiological studies to \nestimate the toxicity of chemicals, but these methods have limitations.\nCONCEPT 14.4B   Many health scientists call for much \ngreater emphasis on pollution prevention to reduce our ex-posure to potentially harmful chemicals.\nMany Factors Determine the Harmful \nHealth Effects of Chemicals\nToxicology is the study of the harmful effects of chemi-\ncals on humans and other organisms. Toxicity is a mea-sure of the ability of a substance to cause injury, illness, or death to a living organism. A basic principle of toxicology is that any synthetic or natural chemical can be harmful if in-gested or inhaled in a large enough quantity. But the critical question is this: At what level of exposure to a particular toxic chemical will the chemical cause harm?\nThis is a difficult question to answer because of the \nmany variables involved in estimating the effects of hu-man exposure to chemicals. A key factor is the dose, the amount of a harmful chemical that a person has ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin at any one time.\nThe effects of a particular chemical can also depend on \nthe age of the person exposed to it. For example, toxic chemicals usually have a greater effect on fetuses, infants, and children than on adults. Current research suggests that exposure to chemical pollutants in the womb may be related to increasing rates of autism, childhood asthma, and learning disorders. Infants and young children are more susceptible to the effects of toxic substances than are adults, for three major reasons. First, they generally breathe more air, drink more water, and eat more food per unit of body weight than do adults. Second, they are ex-posed to toxins in dust and soil when they put their fin-gers, toys, and other objects in their mouths. Third, \nchildren usually have less well-developed immune sys-tems and body detoxification processes than adults have.\nThe EPA has proposed that in determining any risk, \nregulators should assume that children have a 10-times higher risk factor than adults have. Some health scientists suggest that to be on the safe side, we should assume that this risk for children is 100 times the risk for adults.\nToxicity also depends on genetic makeup, which deter -\nmines an individual\u2019s sensitivity to a particular toxin. Some people are sensitive to a number of toxins\u2014a condi-tion known as multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). Another factor is how well the body\u2019s detoxification systems, in-cluding the liver, lungs, and kidneys, are working.\nSeveral other variables can affect the level of harm \ncaused by a chemical. One is its solubility. Water-soluble toxins (which are often inorganic compounds) can move throughout the environment and get into water supplies, as well as the aqueous solutions that surround the cells in our bodies.

By contrast, a chronic effect is a per -\nmanent or long-lasting consequence (kidney or liver dam-age, for example) of exposure to a single dose or to repeated lower doses of a harmful substance.\nSome people have the mistaken idea that all natural \nchemicals are safe and all synthetic chemicals are harmful. In fact, many synthetic chemicals, including many of the medicines we take, are quite safe if used as intended, while many natural chemicals such as lead and mercury (Core Case Study) are deadly.\nScientists Use Live Laboratory Animals and \nNon-Animal Tests to Estimate Toxicity\nThe most widely used method for determining toxicity is to \nexpose a population of live laboratory animals to measured doses of a specific substance under controlled conditions. Laboratory-bred mice and rats are widely used because, as mammals, their systems function, to some degree, simi-larly to human systems. Also, they are small and can re-produce rapidly under controlled laboratory conditions.\nAnimal tests typically take 2\u20135 years, involve hundreds \nto thousands of test animals, and can cost as much as $2 million per substance tested. Some of these tests can be painful to the test animals and can kill or harm them. Ani-mal welfare groups want to limit or ban the use of test ani-mals and, at the very least, want to ensure that they are treated in the most humane manner possible.\nScientists estimate the toxicity of a chemical by deter -\nmining the effects of various doses of the chemical on test organisms and plotting the results in a dose-response \ncurve (Figure 14.11). One approach is to determine the lethal dose\u2014the dose that will kill an animal. A chemical\u2019s median lethal dose (LD50) is the dose that can kill 50% of the animals (usually rats and mice) in a test population within a given time period, usually expressed in milligrams of the chemical per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg). Then sci-entists use mathematical models to extrapolate, or estimate the effects of the chemical on humans, based on the re-sults from testing the chemical on lab animals.\nChemicals vary widely in their toxicity (Table 14.1). \nSome poisons can cause serious harm or death after a single very low dose. Others cause such harm only at dos-\nDOSE-RESPONSE CURVE\n0 225\n05075100\n4 6 8 10 12 14 16\nDose (hypothetical units)Percentage of population killed by a given doseLD50\nFIGURE 14.11   This hypothetical dose-response curve illustrates how \nscientists can estimate the LD50 for a chemical\u2014the dosage that kills \n50% of the animals in a test group.

Most chemicals fall be-tween these two extremes.\nSome scientists challenge the validity of extrapolating \ndata from test animals to humans, because human physi-ology and metabolism often differ from those of the test animals. Other scientists say that such tests and models work fairly well (especially for revealing cancer risks) when the correct experimental animal is chosen or when a chemical is toxic to several different test-animal species.\nMore humane methods for toxicity testing are available \nand are being used more often to replace testing on live ani-mals. They include making computer simulations and using tissue cultures of cells and bacteria, chicken egg mem-branes, and individual animal cells, instead of whole, live animals. High-speed robot testing devices can now screen the biological activity of more than 1 million compounds a day to help determine their possible toxic effects.\nThe problems with estimating toxicities by using labo-\nratory experiments get even more complicated (Concept 14.4A). In real life, each of us is exposed to a variety of chemicals, some of which can interact in ways that de-crease or enhance their short- and long-term individual effects. Toxicologists already have great difficulty in esti-mating the toxicity of a single substance. Adding the prob-lem of evaluating mixtures of potentially toxic substances, isolating the culprits, and determining how they can inter -\nact with one another is overwhelming from a scientific and economic standpoint. For example, just studying the interactions among 3 of the 500 most widely used indus-trial chemicals would take 20.7 million experiments\u2014a physical and financial impossibility.\nThere Are Other Ways to Estimate the \nHarmful Effects of Chemicals\nScientists use several other methods to get information \nabout the harmful effects of chemicals on human health. For example, case reports, usually made by physicians, pro-vide information about people who have suffered from adverse health effects or died after exposure to a chemi-cal. Such information often involves accidental or delib\n-\nerate poisonings, drug overdoses, homicides, or suicide attempts.\nMost case reports are not reliable sources for estimat-\ning toxicity because the actual dosage and the exposed person\u2019s health status are often unknown. But such re-ports can provide clues about environmental hazards and suggest the need for laboratory investigations.\nAnother source of information is epidemiological studies, \nwhich compare the health of people exposed to a particular chemical (the experimental group) with the health of a similar group of people not exposed to the agent (the control group). The goal is to determine whether the statistical association between exposure to a toxic chemical and a health prob-lem is strong, moderate, weak, or undetectable.\nFour factors can limit the usefulness of epidemiological \nstudies. First, in many cases, too few people have been ex-\nposed to high enough levels of a toxic agent to detect sta-tistically significant differences. Second, the studies usually take a long time. Third, closely linking an observed effect with exposure to a particular chemical is difficult because people are exposed to many different toxic agents through-out their lives and can vary in their sensitivity to such chemicals. Fourth, we cannot use epidemiological studies to \nevaluate hazards from new technologies or chemicals to which people have not yet been exposed.\nAre Trace Levels of Toxic Chemicals \nHarmful?\nAlmost everyone who lives in a more-developed country \nis now exposed to potentially harmful chemicals (Figure 14.12) that have built up to trace levels in their blood and in other parts of their bodies. A 2011 CDC study showed that the blood of an average American contains traces of 212 different chemicals, including potentially harmful chemicals such as arsenic and BPA.\nShould we be concerned about trace amounts of", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4086, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a835016-28dc-4942-8d79-5c21170e2c78": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a835016-28dc-4942-8d79-5c21170e2c78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "374", "file_name": "G.

In most cases, we simply do not know because there are too few data and because it is so difficult to determine the effects of exposures to low levels of these chemicals (Concept 14.4A).\nSome scientists view exposures to trace amounts of \nsynthetic chemicals with alarm, especially because of their potential long-term effects on the human immune, ner -\nvous, and endocrine systems. Others scientists view the threats from such exposures as minor. They point out that average life expectancy has been increasing in most coun-tries, especially more-developed countries, for decades. Some scientists contend that the concentrations of such chemicals are so low that they are harmless. All agree that there is a need for much more research on the effects of trace levels of synthetic chemicals on human health.\nWhy Do We Know So Little about the \nHarmful Effects of Chemicals?\nAs we have seen, all methods for estimating toxicity levels \nand risks have serious limitations (Concept 14.4A), but they are all that we have. To take this uncertainty into ac-count and to minimize harm, scientists and regulators typi-cally set allowed levels of exposure to toxic substances at 1/100th or even 1/1,000th of the estimated harmful levels.\nAccording to risk assessment expert Joseph V. Rodricks, \n\u201cToxicologists know a great deal about a few chemicals, a little about many, and next to nothing about most.\u201d The \n90446_ch14_358-385.indd   374 8/13/14   11:07 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Only 2% have been adequately tested to determine whether they are carcinogens, mutagens, or teratogens. Hardly any of the chemicals in commercial use have been screened for possible damage to the human nervous, endocrine, and im-mune systems. Because of insufficient data and the high costs of regulation, federal and state governments do not supervise the use of nearly 99.5% of the commercially available chemicals in the United States, and the problem is much worse in some less-developed countries.\nHow Far Should We Go in Using Pollution \nPrevention and the Precautionary Principle?\nWe know little about the potentially toxic chemicals \naround us and inside of us, and estimating their effects is very difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. So where does this leave us?Some scientists and health officials, especially those in \nEuropean Union countries, are pushing for much greater emphasis on pollution prevention. They say we should not release chemicals that we know or suspect can cause sig-nificant harm into the environment. This means looking for harmless or less harmful substitutes for toxic and haz-ardous chemicals. Another option is to recycle them within production processes to keep them from reaching the environment, as companies such as DuPont and 3M have been doing (see the Case Study that follows).\nPollution prevention is a strategy for implementing the \nprecautionary principle. According to this principle, which can be applied to many other problems, when there is substantial preliminary evidence that an activity, tech-nology, or chemical substance can harm humans, other organisms, or the environment, we should take precau-tionary measures to prevent or reduce such harm, rather than waiting for more conclusive scientific evidence (Con-cept 14.4B).\nThere is controversy over how far we should go in us-\ning the precautionary principle. Some argue that we should avoid using any chemical or technology that would FIGURE 14.12   A number of potentially harmful chemicals are found in many homes.

Others \nsuggest that we should freely use any chemical or technol-ogy that can further human health or comfort or the economy. Most viewpoints fall between these extremes.\nThose who favor a precautionary approach argue that \nthose proposing to introduce a new chemical or technol-ogy should bear the burden of establishing its safety. This requires two major changes in the way we evaluate risks. First, we would assume that new chemicals and technolo-gies could be harmful until scientific studies could show otherwise. Second, the existing chemicals and technologies \nthat appear to have a strong chance of causing significant harm would be removed from the market until we could establish their safety.\nSome movement is being made in the direction of ap-\nplying the precautionary principle, especially in the Euro-pean Union. In 2000, negotiators agreed to a global treaty that would ban or phase out the use of 12 of the most notorious persistent organic pollutants (POPs), also called the \ndirty dozen. These highly toxic chemicals have been shown to produce numerous harmful effects, including cancers, birth defects, compromised immune systems, and a 50% decline in sperm counts and sperm quality in men in a number of countries. The list includes DDT and eight other pesticides, PCBs, and dioxins. In 2009, nine more POPs were added, some of which are widely used in pesticides and in flame-retardants added to clothing, furniture, and other consumer goods. New chemicals will be added to the list when the harm they could potentially cause is seen as outweighing their usefulness. The POPs treaty went into effect in 2004 but has not been formally approved or im-plemented by the United States.\nAt U.S. Congressional hearings in 2009, experts testi-\nfied that the current regulatory system in the United States makes it virtually impossible for the government to limit or ban the use of toxic chemicals. The hearings found that under this system, the EPA had required testing for only 200 of the more than 85,000 chemicals registered for use in the United States and had issued regulations to control fewer than 12 of those chemicals.\nManufacturers and businesses contend that wide-\nspread application of the much more precautionary ap-proach used in the European Union would make it too expensive and almost impossible to introduce any new chemical or technology. It also does not take into account that there is some uncertainty in any scientific assessment of risk. This raises the question of what level of scientific uncertainty about a risk is needed to trigger the use of this principle.\nProponents of increased reliance on using pollution \nprevention agree that we can go too far. But they argue that we have an ethical responsibility to reduce known or potentially serious risks to human health, to the earth\u2019s life-support system, and to future generations, in keep- ing with the ethical social science principle of sustainability.Proponents also point out that using the precautionary \nprinciple focuses the efforts and creativity of scientists, engineers, and businesses on finding solutions to pollution problems based on prevention rather than on cleanup. It also reduces health risks for employees and society, frees businesses from having to deal with pollution regulations, and reduces the threat of lawsuits from injured parties. In some cases, applying this principle helps companies to in-crease their profits from sales of safer products and inno-vative technologies, and it improves the public image of businesses operating in this manner.\nIn 2011, after a 35-year delay promoted by politically \npowerful coal companies and utilities that burn coal to produce electricity, the U.S. government took a step in this direction by issuing a rule to control emissions of mer -\ncury (Core Case Study) and harmful fine-particle pollution from older coal-burning plants in 28 states.

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld these new EPA regulations.\nIn 2013, after 4 years of negotiations, representatives \nfrom many nations developed a U.N. treaty, known as the Minamata Convention, which seeks to curb or end most human-related inputs of mercury into the environment (Core Case Study). The overall goal is to reduce global mer -\ncury emissions by 15\u201335% in the next several decades. By January 2014, it had been signed by 140 countries and ratified, or formally approved, by some, including the United States. It will go into effect after 50 countries have ratified it. Once in effect, within 5 years, nations ratifying the treaty must require new coal-fired power plants, in-dustrial plants, and smelters to use the best available mer -\ncury emission-control technologies. The treaty will also restrict the use of mercury in common household products such as cosmetics, light bulbs, switches, and batteries, and in measuring devices such as barometers, thermometers, and blood pressure monitors.\nCASE STUDY\nPollution Prevention Pays\nThe 3M Company, based in the U.S. state of Minnesota, makes 60,000 different products in 100 manufacturing plants around the world.

The WHO estimates that tobacco use contributed to the deaths of 100 million people during the 20th century and could kill 1 billion people during this century unless individuals and governments act now to dramatically re-duce smoking.\nThe WHO and a 2014 report by the U.S. Surgeon Gen-\neral estimated that each year, tobacco contributes to the premature deaths of about 6 million people resulting from 25 illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabe-tes, lung and other cancers, memory impairment, bronchi-tis, and emphysema (Figure 14.17). This amounts to an average of more than 16,400 deaths every day, or about one every 5 seconds.\nAccording to the WHO, lifelong smokers reduce their life \nspans by an average of 10 years. By 2030, the annual death toll from smoking-related diseases is projected to reach more than 8 million\u2014an average of 21,900 preventable deaths per day\u2014according to the CDC and WHO. About 80% of these deaths are expected to occur in less-developed coun-tries, especially China, where 30% of the world\u2019s smokers live. The annual death toll from smoking in China is about 1.2 million, an average of about 137 deaths every hour.\nAccording to a 2014 CDC report, smoking kills more \nthan 480,000 Americans per year\u2014an average of 1,315 deaths per day, or nearly one every minute (Figure 14.17). This death toll is roughly equivalent to more than six fully loaded 200-passenger jet planes crashing every day of the year with no survivors. Smoking also causes about 8.6 mil-lion illnesses every year in the United States.\nThe overwhelming scientific consensus is that the nic-\notine inhaled in tobacco smoke is highly addictive. A Brit-ish government study showed that adolescents who smoke more than one cigarette have an 85% chance of becoming long-term smokers. \nStudies also show that breathing secondhand smoke   \nposes health hazards. In 2010, the CDC and the California Environmental Protection Agency estimated that second-hand smoke annually contributes to 3,400 lung cancer deaths and 46,000 deaths from heart disease in the United States. A 2010 study by British researchers found that, globally, exposure to secondhand smoke contributes to about 600,000 deaths per year.\nStudies indicate that cigarette smokers die, on average, \n10 years earlier than nonsmokers, but that kicking the habit\u2014even at 50 years of age\u2014can cut such a risk in half. If people quit smoking by the age of 30, they can avoid nearly all the risk of dying prematurely.\nIn the United States, the percentage of adults who \nsmoke dropped from 42% in 1964 to 18% in 2012, ac-cording to the CDC, and the goal is to reduce this to less than 10% by 2025. A 2012 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimated that this de-cline saved 8 million lives and added 2 years to the average U.S. citizen\u2019s life expectancy. This decline can be attributed to media coverage about the harmful health effects of smoking, sharp increases in cigarette taxes in many states, mandatory health warnings on cigarette packs, the ban on \nGOOD\nNEWS\nFIGURE 14.17   There is a \nstartling difference between \nnormal human lungs (left) and the lungs of a person who died of emphysema (right).

These devices contain pure nicotine dissolved in a syrupy solvent with a flavoring to enhance taste and smell. A battery in the device heats the nicotine solution and converts it to a vapor as the user inhales. Smoking e-cigarettes is called vaping. E-cigarettes can be refilled with solutions that vary from 2% to 10% in their concentrations of nicotine.\nAre e-cigarettes safe? No one knows, because they \nhaven\u2019t been around long enough to be thoroughly evalu-ated. E-cigarettes reduce or eliminate the inhalation of tar and numerous other harmful chemicals found in regular cigarette smoke. But they still expose users to highly ad-dictive nicotine, sometimes at levels of up to 5 times as high (10% nicotine) as that found in regular cigarettes (2% nicotine).\nPreliminary research indicates that some e-cigarette \nvapors contain trace amounts of toxic cadmium, nickel, lead, and several substances that can cause cancer in test animals. Some of these toxins, not found in regular ciga-rette smoke, are nanoparticles that are small enough to get past the body\u2019s defense systems and travel deep into the lungs. A preliminary 2014 study by cancer researcher Ma-ciej L. Goniewicz and his colleagues indicated that the high temperatures used to vaporize liquid nicotine could ex-pose users to formaldehyde and a few other known or suspected carcinogens. However, it will take much more research for any direct link between e-cigarettes and can-cer to be established.\nThe European Union (EU) has banned the advertising \nand sales of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to minors, as well as Internet sales of these products. EU regulations also limit the concentration of nicotine in e-cigarettes to 2% and require the disclosure of e-cigarette ingredients. And they require that these products have child-proof and tamper-proof packaging that carries graphic warnings on the harmful health effects of nicotine. In the United States, the FDA proposed similar guidelines in 2014, but they in-clude little or no regulation of Internet sales or of nicotine content of e-cigarettes.\nEstimating Risks from Technologies  \nIs Not Easy\nThe more complex a technological system, and the more \npeople needed to design and run it, the more difficult it is to estimate the risks of using the system. The overall reli-ability of such a system\u2014the probability (expressed as a percentage) that the system will complete a task without failing\u2014is the product of two factors:\nSystem reliability (%) = Technology reliability (%) \u00d7  \nHuman reliability (%)\nWith careful design, quality control, maintenance, and \nmonitoring, a highly complex system such as a nuclear power plant or a deep-sea oil-drilling rig can achieve a high degree of technological reliability. But human reli-ability usually is much lower than technological reliability and is almost impossible to predict.\nSuppose the estimated technological reliability of a \nnuclear power plant is 95% (0.95) and human reliability is 75% (0.75). Then the overall system reliability is 71% (0.95 \u00d7 0.75 =  71%). Even if we could make the technol-\nogy 100% reliable (1.0), the overall system reliability would still be only 75% (1.0 \u00d7  0.75 =  75%).\nWe can make a system more foolproof, or fail-safe, by \nmoving more of the potentially fallible elements from the \nhuman side to the technological side. However, chance events such as a lightning strike can knock out an automatic control system, and no machine or computer program can completely replace human judgment.

Many people deny or shrug off the high-risk chances of death (or injury) from the voluntary activities they enjoy such as motorcycling (with death by motorcycle crash being 30 times more likely than death by car crash), smoking (1 in 250 by age 70 for a pack-a-day smoker), hang gliding (1 in 1,250), and driving (1 in 3,300 without a seatbelt and 1 in 6,070 with a seatbelt). Indeed, the most dangerous thing that many people do each day is to drive or ride in a car.\nYet some of these same people may be terrified about \ntheir chances of being killed by the flu (a 1 in 130,000 chance), a nuclear power plant accident (1 in 200,000), West \nNile virus (1 in 1 million), lightning (1 in 3 million), a com-\nmercial airplane crash (1 in 9 million), snakebite (1 in 36 \nmillion), or shark attack (1 in 281 million).\nFive factors can cause people to see a technology or a \nproduct as being more or less risky than experts judge it to be. First is fear. Research shows that fear causes people to overestimate risks and to worry more about unusual risks than they do about common, everyday risks. Studies show that people tend to overestimate numbers of deaths caused by tornadoes, floods, fires, homicides, cancer, and terrorist attacks, and to underestimate death tolls from flu, diabetes, asthma, heart attack, stroke, and automobile accidents.\nThe second factor in our estimation of risk is the degree \nof control we have in a given situation. Most of us have a greater fear of things over which we do not have personal control. For example, some individuals feel safer driving their own car for long distances than traveling the same distance on a plane. But look at the numbers. The risk of dying in a car accident in the United States while using a seatbelt is 1 in 6,070, whereas the risk of dying in a U.S. commercial airliner crash is about 1 in 9 million.\nThe third factor is whether a risk is catastrophic, not \nchronic. We usually are more frightened by news of cata-strophic accidents such as a plane crash than we are of a cause of death such as smoking, which has a much higher death toll spread out over time.\nFourth, some people suffer from optimism bias, the be-\nlief that risks that apply to other people do not apply to them. While people get upset when they see others driv-ing erratically while talking on a cell phone or texting, they may believe that talking on the cell phone or texting does not impair their own driving ability.\nA fifth factor is that many of the risky things we do are \nhighly pleasurable and give instant gratification, while the potential harm from such activities comes later. Examples are smoking cigarettes, eating lots of ice cream, and getting a tan.Certain Principles Can Help Us Evaluate \nand Reduce Risk\nHere are four guidelines for evaluating and reducing risk \n(Concept 14.5):\n\u2022\tCompare risks. In evaluating a risk, the key question is \nnot \u201cIs it safe?\u201d but rather \u201cHow risky is it compared to other risks?\u201d\n\u2022\tDetermine how much risk you are willing to accept. For most people, a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying or suffering serious harm from exposure to an environmental hazard is a threshold for changing their behavior. However, in establishing standards and reducing risk, the EPA generally assumes that a 1 in 1 million chance of dying from an environmental hazard is acceptable.\n\u2022\tEvaluate the actual risk involved. The news media usually exaggerate the daily risks we face in order to capture our interest and attract more readers, listeners, or television viewers.

When you worry about a risk, the most important question to ask is, \u201cDo I have any control over this?\u201d There is no point worrying about risks over which we have no control. But we do have control over major ways to reduce risks from heart attack, stroke, and certain forms of cancer, because we can decide whether to smoke, what to eat, and how much alcohol to drink. Other factors under our control are whether we practice safe sex, how much exercise we get, and how safely we drive.\n\u2022 We face significant hazards from infectious \ndiseases such as flu, AIDS, tuberculosis, diarrheal \ndiseases, and malaria, and from exposure to chemicals that can cause cancers and birth defects, as well as chemicals that can disrupt the human immune, nervous, and endocrine systems.\n\u2022\n Because of the difficulty of evaluating the harm \ncaused by exposure to chemicals, many health \nscientists call for much greater emphasis on pollution prevention.\n\u2022\n By becoming informed, thinking critically about \nrisks, and making careful choices, we can reduce \nthe major risks we face.BIG IDEAS\n90446_ch14_358-385.indd   381 8/13/14   11:07 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In this chapter, we also learned of many other chemical hazards, as well as biological, physi-cal, cultural, and lifestyle hazards, in the environment. In ad-dition, we saw how difficult it is to evaluate the nature and severity of threats from these various hazards.\nOne of the important facts discussed in this chapter is \nthat on a global basis, the greatest threat to human health is poverty (often leading to malnutrition and disease), followed by the threats from smoking, air pollution, pneumonia and flu, and HIV/AIDS.\nThere are some threats that we can do little to avoid, but \nwe can reduce other threats, partly by applying the three sci-entific principles of sustainability (see Supplement 7,  \np. S50). For example, we can greatly reduce our expo-  \nsure to mercury and other pollutants by shifting from the use of nonrenewable fossil fuels (especially coal) to wider use of  \na diversity of renewable energy resources, including solar en-ergy. We can reduce our exposure to harmful chemicals used in the manufacturing of various goods by cutting resource use and waste and by reusing and recycling material resources. We can also mimic biodiversity by using diverse strategies for solving environmental and health problems, and especially for reducing poverty and controlling population growth.

Workers in a number of industries are exposed to higher levels of various toxic substances than the general public is. Should we reduce the workplace levels allowed for such chemicals? What economic effects might this have?\n 6. Do you think there should be a ban on smoking in-doors in all public places? Explain. Do you think that electronic cigarettes should be taxed and regulated like conventional cigarettes? Explain.\n 7. What are the three major risks you face from each of the following: (a) your lifestyle, (b) where you live, and (c) what you do for a living? Which of these \nrisks are voluntary and which are involuntary? List three steps you could take to reduce each of these risks. Which of these steps do you already take or plan to take?\n 8. In deciding what to do about risks from chemicals in the area where you live, would you support legisla-tion that requires the use of pollution prevention based on the precautionary principle and on the as-sumption that chemicals are potentially harmful until shown otherwise? Explain.\nDoing Environmental Science\nPick a commonly used and potentially harmful chemical and use the library or Internet to learn about (a) what it is used for and how widely it is used, (b) its potential harm, (c) the scientific evidence for such claims, and  (d) proposed solutions for dealing with this threat. Pick a study area, such as your dorm or apartment building, your block, or your city. In this area, try to determine the level of presence of the chemical you are studying. You could do this by finding four or five examples of items or locations containing the chemical and then estimating the total amount based on your sample. Write a report sum-marizing your findings.\n90446_ch14_358-385.indd   384 8/13/14   11:07 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The ice that covers most of this mountainous island lies in glaciers that are as  \ndeep as 3.2 kilometers (2 miles).\nAreas of the island\u2019s ice have been \nmelting at an accelerating rate during Greenland\u2019s summers (Figure 15.1). Some of this ice is replaced by snow during winter months, but the annual net loss of Greenland\u2019s ice has increased during recent years.\nSo why should we care if ice in \nGreenland is melting? The answer is, considerable scientific evidence indi-cates that a key factor in this melting is atmospheric warming\u2014the gradual \nrise of the average temperature of the atmosphere near the earth\u2019s land and water surfaces for 30 years or more. During this century, this warming is projected to increase significantly and to lead to climate change,  \nwhich is very likely to have harmful effects on most  \nof the earth\u2019s ecosystems, people, and economies.\nGreenland\u2019s glaciers \ncontain enough water to raise the global sea level  \nby as much as 7 meters  \n(23 feet) if all of it were  \nto melt and drain into the sea. It is highly unlikely that this will happen, but even a moderate loss of this ice over one or several centuries would raise sea levels considerably (see chapter-opening photo). According to a 2014 study by earth scientist Michael Bevis, Greenland\u2019s ice loss has been responsible for nearly one-sixth of the global sea-level rise over the past 20 years. Accord-ing to some scientists, Greenland\u2019s melting ice is an early warning that human activities are very likely to disrupt the earth\u2019s climate in ways that could threaten life as we know it, especially during the latter half of this century.\nIn 1988, the World Meteorological \nOrganization and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to document past climate changes and project future climate changes. The IPCC network includes more than 2,500 climate scientists and scientists in disciplines related to climate studies from more than 130 countries.\nAfter reviewing tens of thou-  \nsands of research studies for more than 25 years, the IPCC and most of the world\u2019s major scientific bodies, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the British Royal Soci-ety, have come to three major conclu-sions: (1) climate change is real and is \nhappening now, (2) it is caused pri-marily by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and the clearing of forests, and (3) it is projected to accelerate, especially during the latter half of this century, unless we act now to slow it down and reduce its numer -\nous harmful effects.\nIn this chapter, we examine the \nnature of the atmosphere, air pollu-tion, the likely causes and effects of projected climate change, and deple-tion of ozone in the stratosphere.  \nWe also look at some possible ways  \nto deal with these serious environ-mental, economic, and political challenges.\nMelting Ice in Greenland\n388 \nCompiled by the authors using data from Konrad Steffen, Russell Huff, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n1982 2012\nFIGURE 15.1   The total area of Greenland\u2019s glacial ice that melted by July 8, 2012 (red area in right image) \nwas much greater than the amount that melted during the summer of 1982 (left).\n90446_ch15_386-427.indd   388 8/13/14   2:24 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

It is divided into several spherical layers (Figure 15.2).\nAbout 75\u201380% of the earth\u2019s air mass is found in the \ntroposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to the earth\u2019s surface. This layer extends about 17 kilometers (11 miles) above sea level at the equator and 6 kilometers (4 miles) above sea level over the poles. If the earth were the size of an apple, this lower layer containing the air we breathe would be no thicker than the apple\u2019s skin.Take a deep breath. About 99% of the volume of air \nyou inhaled consists of two gases: nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The remainder is 0.93% argon (Ar), 0.040% carbon dioxide (CO\n2), and small amounts of water \nvapor (H 2O, varying from the equator to the poles), dust \nand soot particles, and other gases, including methane (CH\n4), ozone (O 3), and nitrous oxide (N 2O).\nSeveral gases in the atmosphere, including H 2O, CO 2, \nCH 4, and N 2O, are called greenhouse gases because they \nabsorb and release energy that warms the troposphere. Ris-ing and falling air currents, winds, and concentrations of CO\n2 \nand other greenhouse gases in the troposphere play major roles in the planet\u2019s short-term weather and long-term climate.\nThe atmosphere\u2019s second layer is the stratosphere, \nwhich extends from about 17 to about 48 kilometers (from 11 to 30 miles) above the earth\u2019s surface (Figure 15.2). Al-though the stratosphere contains less matter than the tropo-sphere, its composition is similar, with two notable exceptions: its volume of water vapor is about 1/1,000th that of the tro-posphere and its concentration of ozone (O\n3) is much higher.\nMuch of the atmosphere\u2019s small amount of ozone (O 3) \nis concentrated in a portion of the stratosphere called the ozone layer, found roughly 17\u201326 kilometers (11\u201316 miles) above sea level. Most stratospheric ozone is pro-duced when some of the oxygen molecules in this layer interact with ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the sun.\n3 O\n2 + UV \u2194  2 O 3\nThis UV filtering effect of ozone in the lower strato-\nsphere acts as a \u201cglobal sunscreen\u201d that keeps about 95% of the sun\u2019s harmful UV radiation from reaching the earth\u2019s surface. It allows us and other life-forms to exist on land and helps to protect us from sunburn, skin and eye cancers, cataracts, and damage to our immune systems. It also prevents much of the oxygen in the troposphere from being converted to photochemical ozone, a harmful air pollutant when found near the ground. The stratospheric ozone layer is a vital part of the earth\u2019s natural capital that helps to keep us and other species alive, allows us to live on land, and supports our economies.\n15.2 WHAT ARE THE MAJOR AIR \nPOLLUTION PROBLEMS?\nCONCEPT 15.2A   Three major outdoor air pollution prob-\nlems are industrial smog caused mostly by the burning of \ncoal, photochemical smog caused by motor vehicle and in-\ndustrial emissions, and acid deposition caused mainly by coal-burning power and industrial plants and motor vehicle emissions.\nCONCEPT 15.2B   The most threatening indoor air pollut-\nants are smoke and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3403, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e43c9c4c-6dfb-488e-9957-a36587455cef": {"__data__": {"id_": "e43c9c4c-6dfb-488e-9957-a36587455cef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "389", "file_name": "G.

Almost any chemical in the atmosphere can become a pol-lutant if it occurs in a high enough concentration. The ef-fects of air pollution range from annoying to lethal.\nAir pollutants come from natural and human sources. \nNatural sources include wind-blown dust, pollutants from wildfires and volcanic eruptions, and volatile organic chem-icals released by some plants. Most natural air pollutants are spread out over the globe and diluted or are removed by chemical cycles, precipitation, and gravity. But in areas ex-periencing volcanic eruptions or forest fires, chemicals emit-ted by these sources can temporarily reach harmful levels.\nMost human inputs of outdoor air pollutants occur in \nindustrialized and urban areas where people, cars, and factories are concentrated. These pollutants are generated mostly by the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and industrial facilities (stationary sources) and in motor vehicles (mobile sources).\nScientists classify outdoor air pollutants into two cate-\ngories (Figure 15.3). Primary pollutants are chemicals or substances emitted directly into the air from natural processes and human activities at concentrations high enough to cause harm. While in the atmosphere, some primary pollutants react with one another and with other natural components of air to form new harmful chemicals, called secondary pollutants.\nOutdoor air pollution was once a regional problem \nlimited mostly to cities. Now it is a global problem, largely due to the sheer volume of pollutants produced by human activities. Prevailing winds can spread long-lived pollut-ants entering the atmosphere from India and China across the Pacific where they affect air pollution levels on the west coast of North America. There is no place on the planet\u2019s surface that has not been affected by air pollution from human activities.\nOver the past 40 years, the quality of outdoor air in \nmost of the more-developed countries has improved greatly. This has occurred primarily because grassroots pressure from citizens, especially during the 1970s, led governments in the United States and in most European countries to pass and enforce air-pollution-control laws.\nOn the other hand, according to the World Health Orga-\nnization (WHO), more than 1.1 billion people (one of every six people on the earth) live in urban areas where outdoor air is unhealthy to breathe. Most of them live in densely populated cities in less-developed countries where air-\n \npollution-control laws do not exist or are poorly enforced.\nFIGURE 15.3   human inputs of air pollutants come from mobile sources (such as cars) and stationary \nsources (such as industrial, power, and cement plants). Some primary air pollutants react with one an-\nother and with other chemicals in the air to form secondary air pollutants.\nPrimary Pollutants\nNatural SourceSecondary Pollutants\nMobileStationary Human Source\nHuman SourceCO\nCH4 and most other hydrocarbons\nMost suspended particlesCO2\nSO2 NO NO2N2O\nSO3\nHNO3 H2SO4\nH2O2\nMost NO3\u2013 and SO42\u2013 saltsO3 PANs\n\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\n90446_ch15_386-427.indd   390 8/13/14   2:24 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, \nodorless, and highly toxic gas that forms during the in-\ncomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials. Ma-jor sources are motor vehicle exhaust, the burning of forests and grasslands, the smokestacks of fossil fuel\u2013burn-ing power plants and industries, tobacco smoke, open fires, and inefficient stoves used for cooking or heating.\nCO can combine with hemoglobin in red blood cells, \nwhich reduces the ability of blood to transport oxygen to body cells and tissues. Long-term exposure can trigger heart attacks and aggravate lung diseases such as asthma and emphysema. At high levels, CO can cause headache, nausea, drowsiness, confusion, collapse, coma, and death.\nCarbon dioxide (CO\n2) is a colorless, odorless gas. About \n93% of the CO 2 in the atmosphere is the result of the natu-\nral carbon cycle (see Figure 3.14, p. 53), and the rest comes from human activities. There is considerable and growing sci-entific evidence that the rapid rise in atmospheric CO\n2 levels \nsince 1950 (see Figure 11, p. S43, in Supplement 5) is largely due to human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and the removal of CO\n2-absorbing forests and grasslands. \nAccording to the IPCC, this increase in CO 2 levels is a major \ncause of atmospheric warming, which will very likely lead to increasingly harmful climate change during this century, unless we act now to sharply reduce our CO\n2 emissions.\nNitrogen Oxides and Nitric Acid.   Nitric oxide (NO) is a \ncolorless gas that forms when nitrogen and oxygen gases react under high-combustion temperatures in automobile engines and coal-burning power and industrial plants. Lightning and certain bacteria in soil and water also produce NO as part of the nitrogen cycle (see Figure 3.15, p. 54).\nIn the air, NO reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide  \n(NO\n2), a reddish-brown gas. Collectively, NO and NO 2 are \ncalled nitrogen oxides (NO x). Some of the NO 2 reacts with \nwater vapor in the air to form nitric acid (HNO 3) and nitrate \nsalts (NO 3\u2212), components of harmful acid deposition, which \nwe discuss later in this chapter. Both NO and NO 2 play a \nrole in the formation of photochemical smog\u2014a mixture of chemicals formed under the influence of sunlight in cities with heavy traffic (discussed further below). Nitrous oxide  \n(N\n2O), a greenhouse gas, is emitted from fertilizers and ani-\nmal wastes, and is produced by the burning of fossil fuels.\nAt high enough levels, nitrogen oxides can irritate the \neyes, nose, and throat, aggravate lung ailments such as asthma and bronchitis, suppress plant growth, and reduce vis-ibility when they are converted to nitric acid and nitrate salts.\nSulfur Dioxide and Sulfuric Acid.\n  Sulfur dioxide (SO 2) is \na colorless gas with an irritating odor. About one-third of \nthe SO 2 in the atmosphere comes from natural sources such \nas volcanoes. The other two-thirds (and as much as 90% in some urban areas) come from human sources, mostly com-bustion of sulfur-containing coal in power and industrial plants, oil refining, and the smelting of sulfide ores.\nIn the atmosphere, SO\n2 can be converted to aerosols, \nwhich consist of microscopic suspended droplets of sulfuric acid (H\n2SO4) and suspended particles of sulfate (SO 42\u2212) \nsalts that return to the earth as a component of acid depo-sition.

Sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid droplets, and sulfate particles reduce visibility and aggravate breathing prob-lems. They can damage crops, trees, soils, and aquatic life in lakes. And they corrode metals and damage paint, pa-per, leather, and the stone used to build walls, statues, and monuments.\nParticulates.\n  Suspended particulate matter (SPM) consists \nof a variety of solid particles and liquid droplets that are \nsmall and light enough to remain suspended in the air for long periods. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies particles as fine, or PM-10 (with diameters less than 10 micrometers), and ultrafine, or PM-2.5 (with diameters less than 2.5 micrometers). About 62% of the SPM in outdoor air comes from natural sources such as dust, wildfires, and sea salt. The remaining 38% comes from human sources such as coal-burning power and in-dustrial plants, motor vehicles, wind erosion from exposed topsoil, and road construction.\nThese particles can irritate the nose and throat, damage \nthe lungs, aggravate asthma and bronchitis, and shorten life spans. Toxic particulates such as lead and cadmium can cause genetic mutations, reproductive problems, and can-cer. Particulates also reduce visibility, corrode metals, and discolor clothing and paints.\nOzone.\n  One of the major ingredients of photochemical smog \nis ozone (O 3), a colorless and highly reactive gas. It can cause \ncoughing and breathing problems, aggravate lung and heart \ndiseases, reduce resistance to colds and pneumonia, and ir -\nritate the eyes, nose, and throat. It also damages plants, rubber in tires, fabrics, and paints. Scientific measurements indicate that some human activities have decreased the amount of beneficial ozone in the stratosphere and have increased the amount of harmful ozone in the troposphere near ground level\u2014especially in some urban areas.\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).\n  Organic com-\npounds that exist as gases in the atmosphere or that \nevaporate from sources on earth into the atmosphere are called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Examples are hy-\ndrocarbons, emitted by the leaves of many plants, and methane (CH\n4), a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more ef-\nfective per molecule than CO 2 is at warming the atmo-\nsphere. About a third of global methane emissions come from natural sources, mostly plants, wetlands, and ter -\nmites. The rest come from human sources such as rice paddies, landfills, natural gas wells and pipelines, and cows (mostly from their belching).\n90446_ch15_386-427.indd   391 8/13/14   2:24 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Examples are benzene and other liquids \nused as industrial solvents, dry-cleaning fluids, and various components of gasoline, plastics, and other products.\nBurning Coal Produces Industrial Smog\nSeventy years ago, cities such as London, England, and the U.S. cities of Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylva-nia, burned large amounts of coal in power plants and fac-tories, and for heating homes and often for cooking food. People in such cities, especially during winter, were ex-posed to industrial smog, consisting mostly of an un-healthy mix of sulfur dioxide, suspended droplets of sulfuric acid, and a variety of suspended solid particles in outside air. Those who burned coal inside their homes were often exposed to dangerous levels of indoor air pollutants.\nToday, urban industrial smog is rarely a problem in \nmost of the more-developed countries where coal is burned only in large power and industrial plants with rea-sonably good pollution control. However, industrial smog remains a problem in industrialized urban areas of China, India, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia (Figure 15.4), Bulgaria, and Poland, where large quantities of coal are still burned in houses, power plants, and factories with inadequate pollution controls. Because of its heavy reliance on coal, China has some of the world\u2019s highest levels of industrial smog and 16 of the world\u2019s 20 most polluted cities. Ac-cording to a 2014 Chinese government report, 92% of all Chinese cities did not meet the government\u2019s national out-door air quality standards in 2013.\nSunlight Plus Cars Equals  \nPhotochemical Smog\nA photochemical reaction is any chemical reaction activated \nby light.

The NO \nis converted to reddish-brown NO 2, which is why photo-\nchemical smog is sometimes called brown-air smog. When exposed to ultraviolet radiation from the sun, some of the NO\n2 reacts in complex ways with VOCs released by certain \ntrees (such as some oak species, sweet gums, and poplars), motor vehicles, and businesses (especially bakeries and dry cleaners). The resulting mixture of pollutants, domi-nated by ground-level ozone, usually builds up to peak levels by late morning, irritating people\u2019s eyes and respira-tory tracts. Some of these pollutants, known as photochemi-cal oxidants, can damage lung tissue.\nAll modern cities have some photochemical smog, but  \nit is much more common in cities with sunny and warm climates, and a great number of motor vehicles. Examples are Los Angeles, California (Figure 15.5), and Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States; Sydney, Australia; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Bangkok, Thailand; and Mexico City, Mexico.\nSeveral Factors Can Decrease or Increase \nOutdoor Air Pollution\nFive natural factors help reduce outdoor air pollution. \nFirst, particles heavier than air settle out as a result of gravi-\ntational attraction to the earth. Second, rain and snow par -\ntially cleanse the air of pollutants. Third, salty sea spray from the oceans washes out many pollutants from air that \nflows from land over the oceans. Fourth, winds sweep pol-lutants away and dilute them by mixing them with cleaner air. And fifth, some pollutants are removed by chemical reactions. For example, SO\n2 can react with O 2 in \nthe atmosphere to form SO 3, which reacts with water va-\npor to form droplets of H 2SO4 that fall out of the atmo-\nsphere as acidic precipitation.\nSix other factors can increase outdoor air pollution. First, \nurban buildings slow wind speed and reduce the dilution and removal of pollutants. Second, hills and mountains re-duce the flow of air in valleys below them and allow pollut-ant levels to build up at ground level. Third, high temperatures  \npromote the chemical reactions leading to the formation of photochemical smog. Fourth, emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from certain trees and plants in urban areas can promote the formation of photochemical smog.\nThe fifth factor\u2014the so-called grasshopper effect\u2014occurs \nwhen air pollutants are transported at high altitudes by evaporation and winds from tropical and temperate areas through the atmosphere to the earth\u2019s polar areas as part of the earth\u2019s global air circulation system (see Figure 7.3, p. 132). This happens mostly during winter. It explains why, for decades, pilots have reported seeing a reddish-brown haze over the Arctic. It also helps explain why po-lar bears, sharks, and native peoples in remote arctic areas FIGURE 15.5   Photochemical smog is a serious problem in Los Angeles, California, although air pol-\nlution laws have helped to reduce the average number of severe smog days per year.

During daylight, the sun warms the air near the earth\u2019s surface. Normally, this warm air and most of the pollut-ants it contains rise to mix with the cooler air above and are dispersed. Under certain atmospheric conditions, how-ever, a layer of warm air can temporarily lie atop a layer of cooler air nearer the ground, and this is called a tempera-ture inversion. Because the cooler air near the surface is denser than the warmer air above, it does not rise and mix with the air above. If this condition persists, pollutants can build up to harmful and even lethal concentrations in the stagnant layer of cool air near the ground.\nAcid Deposition Is a Serious Regional Air \nPollution Problem\nMost coal-burning power plants, metal ore smelters, oil \nrefineries, and other industrial facilities emit sulfur dioxide (SO\n2), suspended particles, and nitrogen oxides (NO x). In \nmore-developed countries, these facilities usually use tall smokestacks to vent their exhausts high into the atmo-sphere where wind can dilute and disperse these pollut-ants. This reduces local air pollution, but it can increase regional air pollution, because prevailing winds can trans-port the SO\n2 and NO x pollutants as far as 1,000 kilometers \n(600 miles). During their trip, these compounds form sec-ondary pollutants such as droplets of sulfuric acid (H\n2SO4), \nnitric acid vapor (HNO 3), and particles of acid-forming \nsulfate (SO 42\u2212) and nitrate (NO 3\u2212) salts (Figure 15.3).\nThese acidic substances remain in the atmosphere for \n2\u201314 days. During this period, they descend to the earth\u2019s surface in two forms: wet deposition, consisting of acidic rain, snow, fog, and cloud vapor, and dry deposition, con-sisting of acidic particles. The resulting mixture is called acid deposition (Figure 15.6)\u2014often called acid rain.  \nMost dry deposition occurs within 2\u20133 days of emission, relatively close to the industrial sources, whereas most wet deposition takes place within 4\u201314 days in more dis-tant downwind areas.\nAcid deposition is a problem in areas that lie down-\nwind from coal-burning facilities and from urban areas with large numbers of cars (Concept 15.2A) (Figure 15.7). In some areas, soils contain compounds that can react with and help neutralize, or buffer, some inputs of acids.

A combination of acid deposition and other air pollut-ants can affect forests by leaching essential plant nutrients such as calcium and magnesium from forest soils and by releasing from the soils ions of aluminum, lead, cadmium, and mercury, which are toxic to trees. These two effects rarely kill trees directly, but they can weaken them and leave them vulnerable to stresses such as severe cold, dis-eases, insect attacks, and drought.\nAcid deposition damages statues and buildings, con-\ntributes to human respiratory diseases, and can leach toxic metals such as lead and mercury from soils and rocks into lakes used as sources of drinking water. These toxic metals can accumulate in the tissues of fish and of the animals that eat them, including people. This presents a serious health threat, especially for pregnant women (see Chapter 14, Core Case Study, p. 360). Because of excess acidity due to acid deposition, several thousand lakes in Norway and Sweden, and 1,200 lakes in Ontario, Canada, contain few if any fish. In the United States, several hundred lakes (most of them in the Northeast) are similarly threatened.\nIn the United States, older coal-burning power and in-\ndustrial plants without adequate pollution controls, espe-cially in the Midwest, emit the largest quantities of SO\n2, \nparticulates, and other pollutants that cause acid deposi-tion. Because of these emissions and those of other urban industries and motor vehicles, and because of the prevail-ing west-to-east winds, typical precipitation in parts of the eastern United States can be at least 10 times more acidic than natural precipitation is. Some mountaintop forests in the eastern United States and in areas to the east of large western U.S. cities are bathed in fog and dews that are about 1,000 times as acidic as normal precipitation.\nThis has also become an international problem wher -\never acid-producing emissions from one country are trans-ported to other countries by prevailing winds. The worst acid deposition occurs in Asia, especially in China, which gets 68% of its total energy and 73% of its electricity from burning coal, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Some of eastern Asia\u2019s emissions are trav-eling on strong winds all the way across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of North America.\nPotential problem areas because of sensitive soils\nPotential problem areas because of air pollution:\nemissions leading to acid deposition\nCurrent problem areas (including lakes and rivers)\nFIGURE 15.7   Regions where acid deposition is now a problem and regions with the potential to de-\nvelop this problem.

Since 1994, acid deposition has de-\ncreased sharply in the United States and especially in the east-ern half of the country, partly because of significant reductions in SO\n2 and NO x emissions from coal-fired power and indus-\ntrial plants under the 1990 amendments to the U.S. Clean Air Act. Figure 15.8 lists several ways to reduce acid deposition.\nImplementing prevention solutions is politically diffi-\ncult. One problem is that the people and ecosystems af-fected by acid deposition often are quite far downwind from the sources of the problem. Also, countries with large supplies of coal (such as China, India, Russia, Australia, and the United States) have a strong incentive to use it. However, in the United States, the increasing use of af-fordable wind (see Chapter 13, Core Case Study, p. 314) and cleaner-burning natural gas for generating electricity has reduced the use of coal to some extent.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nCONNECTIONS Low-Sulfur Coal, Atmospheric \nWarming, and Toxic Mercury\nSome U.S. power plants have lowered SO 2 emissions by switching from high-\nsulfur to low-sulfur coals such as lignite (see Figure 13.11, p. 324). However, \nbecause low-sulfur coal has a lower heat value, more coal must be burned to generate a given amount of electricity, and this has led to increased CO\n2 emis-\nsions, which contribute to atmospheric warming and climate change. Low-sulfur coal also has higher levels of toxic mercury and other trace metals, so by burning it, we emit more of these hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere.Indoor Air Pollution Is a Serious Problem\nIn less-developed countries, the indoor burning of wood, \ncharcoal, dung, crop residues, coal, and other fuels in open fires (Figure 15.9) or in unvented or poorly vented stoves exposes people to dangerous levels of particulate air pollu-tion (Concept 15.2B). According to a 2014 report by the WHO, indoor air pollution is the world\u2019s most serious air pollution problem, especially for poor people. In 2012, the WHO estimated that such pollution killed 4.3 million peo-ple\u2014an average of 11,780 deaths per day.\nIndoor air pollution is also a serious problem in more-\ndeveloped areas of all countries, mostly because of the chemicals used to make building materials and products such as furniture and paneling. Figure 15.10 shows some typical sources of indoor air pollution in a modern home.\nEPA studies have revealed some alarming facts about \nindoor air pollution. First, levels of 11 common air pollut-ants generally are 2 to 5 times higher inside U.S. homes and commercial buildings than they are outdoors, and in some cases they are as much as 100 times higher. Second,  \npollution levels inside cars in traffic-clogged urban areas can be up to 18 times higher than outside levels. Third, the health risks from exposure to such chemicals are growing \nAcid Deposition\nAdd lime to \nneutralize\nacidi/f_ied lakes\nAdd phosphate\nfertilizer to \nneutralize\nacidi/f_ied lakes\nAdd lime to \nneutralize acidi/f_ied soilsReduce coal use and burn only low-sulfur coal\nUse natural gas and \nrenewable energy resources in place of coal\nRemove SO\n2 and NO x \nfrom smokestack gases \nand remove NO x from \nmotor vehicular exhaust\nTax SO2 emissionsPrevention CleanupSolutions\nFIGURE 15.8   Ways to reduce acid deposition and its damage. \nQuestions:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3629, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78e0f55c-c400-4aa8-bba6-82cc3e5ca90c": {"__data__": {"id_": "78e0f55c-c400-4aa8-bba6-82cc3e5ca90c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "396", "file_name": "G.

Fine and ultrafine particulates get lodged deep in the lungs and contribute to lung cancer, asthma, heart attack, and stroke. Years of smoking or breathing polluted air can lead to other lung ailments such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, which leads to acute shortness of breath.\nIn 2014, the WHO estimated that each year, indoor \nand outdoor air pollution kills about 7 million people. This averages out to about 800 deaths every hour. More than a third of these deaths occur in China (Figure 15.12) and India.\nIn 2013, Steven Barrett and other researchers at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) estimated that outdoor air pollution, mostly fine-particle pollution, contributes to the deaths of roughly 200,000 Americans every year. About half of these deaths are blamed on car and truck exhaust and the other half on coal-burning power and industrial plants (Figure 15.13). This death toll is roughly equivalent to that of two fully loaded, 275-passenger airliners crashing every day of the year with no survivors. Millions more suffer from asthma at-tacks and other respiratory disorders brought on by indoor and outdoor air pollution.\nAccording to EPA studies, each year, more than \n125,000 Americans get cancer from breathing soot-laden diesel fumes emitted by buses, trucks, tractors, bulldoz-ers and other construction equipment, trains, and ships. A large diesel truck emits as much particulate matter as 150 cars, and according to a study led by Daniel Lack, the world\u2019s 100,000 or more diesel-powered oceangoing ships emit almost half as much particulate pollution as do the world\u2019s 1 billion cars. Thus, the largely unregu-lated shipping industry is one of the largest polluters of the atmosphere.\n15.3 HOW SHOULD WE DEAL WITH \nAIR POLLUTION?\nCONCEPT 15.3   Legal, economic, and technological tools \ncan help us to clean up air pollution, but the best solution \nis to prevent it.\nLaws and Regulations Can Reduce Outdoor \nAir Pollution\nThe United States provides an excellent example of how a \nregulatory approach can reduce air pollution (Concept 15.3). The U.S. Congress passed the Clean Air Acts in 1970, 1977, and 1990. With these laws, the federal government estab-lished air pollution regulations for key outdoor air pollutants that are enforced by states and major cities.\nCongress directed the EPA to establish air quality stan-\ndards for six major outdoor pollutants\u2014carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO\n2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), sus-\npended particulate matter (SPM, smaller than PM-10), ozone (O\n3), and lead (Pb). Each standard specifies the \nmaximum allowable level for a pollutant, averaged over a specific period.

Emissions during this period dropped by 99% for lead (Pb), 79% for SO\n2, 72% \nfor CO, 66% for PM-10, 59% for NO x, 57% for volatile \norganic compounds, and 25% for ground-level ozone (O\n3).\nThe reduction of outdoor air pollution in the United \nStates since 1970 has been a remarkable success story, mostly because of two factors. First, during the 1970s, U.S. citizens insisted that laws be passed and enforced to im-prove air quality. Prior to 1970, when Congress passed the Clean Air Act, air-pollution-control equipment did not ex-ist. Second, the country was affluent enough to afford such \ncontrols and improvements. For example, as a result of these factors, a new car today in the United States emits 75% less pollution than did a pre-1970 car.GOOD\nNEWS\n90446_ch15_386-427.indd   399 8/13/14   2:24 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

For ex-ample, with the goal of reducing SO\n2 emissions, the Clean \nAir Act of 1990 authorized an emissions trading, or cap-and-trade program, which enables the 110 most polluting coal-fired power plants in 21 states to buy and sell SO\n2 air \npollution rights.\nUnder this system, each plant is annually given a num-\nber of pollution credits, which allow it to emit a certain amount of SO\n2. A utility that emits less than its allotted \namount has a surplus of pollution credits. That utility can use its credits to offset SO\n2 emissions at its other plants, \nkeep them for future plant expansions, or sell them to other utilities or private citizens or groups. Between 1990 and 2012, this emissions trading program helped to reduce SO\n2 emissions from power plants in the United States by \n76%, at a cost of less than one-tenth of the cost projected by the utility industry, according to the EPA.\nProponents of this market-based approach say it is \ncheaper and more efficient than government regulation of air pollution. Critics of this approach contend that it allows utilities with older, dirtier power plants to buy their way out of their environmental responsibilities and to continue to pollute.\nThe ultimate success of any emissions trading approach \ndepends on two factors: how low the initial cap is set and how often it is lowered in order to promote continuing in-novation in air pollution prevention and control. Without these two elements, emissions trading programs can shift pollution problems from one area to another without achieving an overall improvement in air quality.\nThere Are Many Ways to Reduce Outdoor \nAir Pollution\nFigure 15.14 summarizes several ways to reduce emissions \nof sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter from stationary sources such as coal-burning power plants", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3666, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76d9ead1-5360-4690-a1af-6787fddbc2f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "76d9ead1-5360-4690-a1af-6787fddbc2f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "400", "file_name": "G.

Weather con-\nsists of short-term changes in atmospheric variables such as the temperature, precipitation, wind, and barometric pressure in a given area over a period of hours or days. By contrast, climate is determined by the average weather \nconditions of the earth or of a particular area, especially temperature and precipitation, over periods of at least three decades to thousands of years, according to the World Meteorological Society. Scientists have used long-term measurements of atmospheric temperature and pre-cipitation to divide the earth into various climate zones (see Figure 7.2, p. 131).\nDuring any period of 30 or more years, in a given area \nof the planet, there will often be hotter years and cooler years, and wetter years and drier years, as weather often fluctuates widely from day to day and from year to year. Climate scientists look at data on the normally fluctuating weather conditions for the earth as a whole and for par -\nticular areas of the earth to see if there has been a general rise or fall in measurements such as average temperature or precipitation over a period of at least 30 years. This is the only way they can determine how the climate of an area has changed, if at all. Thus, people who claim that an unusually cold winter, year, or even decade disproves at-mospheric warming and climate change, and those who argue that an unusually warm summer, year, or decade demonstrates such warming and climate change, are mak-ing a common error by confusing weather with climate.\nAtmospheric warming and climate change are often re-\nferred to as \u201cglobal warming,\u201d which is a misleading term. It does not mean that all areas of the earth are getting warmer every year. Instead, as the earth\u2019s average atmo-spheric temperature rises, some areas get warmer at various times and some get cooler. However, when the global aver -\nage atmospheric temperature rises or drops over a period of at least three decades, the earth\u2019s climate has changed.\nClimate Change Is Not New but Recently \nHas Accelerated\nClimate change is neither new nor unusual. Over the past \n3.5 billion years, the planet\u2019s climate has been altered by factors such as volcanic eruptions, changes in solar input, continents moving slowly atop shifting tectonic plates (see Figure 4.D, p. 76), impacts by large meteors, the planet\u2019s wobbly orbit around the sun, and the fact that the earth is tilted in its orbital plane. The earth\u2019s climate is also affected by global air circulation patterns (see Figure 7.3, p. 132), large areas of ice (Core Case Study) that reflect incoming solar energy and help to cool the atmosphere, varying concentrations of the greenhouse gases found in the atmo-sphere, and occasional changes in ocean currents (see Fig-ure 7.5, p. 133).\nOver the past 900,000 years, the atmosphere has expe-\nrienced climate change as a result of prolonged periods of considerable atmospheric warming and atmospheric cool-ing that led to ice ages (Figure 15.18). These alternating cycles of freezing and thawing are known as glacial and \ninterglacial (between ice ages) periods.\nFor roughly 10,000 years, we have had the good for -\ntune to live in an interglacial period characterized by a fairly stable climate based on a generally steady global av-erage surface temperature.

Scien-\ntific evidence indicates that this slowdown in the rate of atmospheric warming very likely is temporary and results from a combination of factors, including (1) short-term natural weather variations such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (see Figure 7.6, p. 134); (2) atmospheric ash from at least 17 volcanic eruptions since 2000 that have had a short-term cooling effect because sulfates in the \n volcanic emissions reflect sunlight; (3) increased air pollu-tion from China and India that tend to cool the atmo-sphere similar to volcanic eruptions; (4) no net increase in energy from the sun since the 1970s; and (5) economic \ndownturns such as the one between 2008 and 2012 that led to lower CO\n2 emissions from the burning of fossil \nfuels.\nIn 2014, researchers Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way \nreviewed and found gaps in the worldwide atmospheric temperature data, as well as ways to fill some of those gaps by using satellite measurements. They concluded that at-mospheric warming between 1997 and 2012 slowed by only about half as much as had been previously reported. In other words, warming during that period had been seri-ously underestimated. Other researchers are now examin-ing their findings.\nThe Greenhouse Effect Plays a Key Role in \nClimate Change\nThe natural process called the greenhouse effect (see \nFigure 3.3, p. 44) plays a major role in determining the earth\u2019s climate. It occurs when some of the solar energy absorbed by the earth radiates into the atmosphere as in-frared radiation (heat). As this radiation interacts with molecules in the air\u2014especially the four major greenhouse gases, water vapor (H\n2O), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane \n(CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2O)\u2014it increases the kinetic \nenergy of air molecules and warms the lower atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface.\nLife on the earth and human economies are totally de-\npendent on the greenhouse effect\u2014one of the planet\u2019s most important forms of natural capital. It keeps the planet at a comfortable average temperature of around 15\u00b0C (58\u00b0F). Without it, the planet would be a frozen, un-inhabitable place.\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the \nmid-1700s, human actions\u2014mainly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture\u2014have led to signifi-cant increases in the concentrations of several greenhouse gases, especially CO\n2, in the lower atmosphere (see Figure \n11, p. S43, Supplement 5). The average atmospheric con-centration of CO\n2 rose by about 40% between 1880 and \n2012 with more than half of the increase taking place since 1970. This is a long-lasting increase because CO\n2 typically remains in the atmosphere for 100 years or more. After oscillating between 180 and 280 parts per million (ppm) for 400,000 years, the concentration of CO\n2 in the \natmosphere averaged 396 ppm in 2013\u2014higher than at any time in the last 800,000 years.\nAlso, since 1750, roughly the beginning of the Indus-\ntrial Revolution, atmospheric methane levels have risen by 160%. According to a 2014 study by earth scientist Euan G.\n\tNisbet\tand\this\tcolleagues, \tabout\ttwo-thirds \tof\tthe\tglobal\t\nemissions of methane are caused by human activities and the other third come from natural sources.\nIn 2012, the three largest emitters of energy-related \nCO\n2 were China, the United States, and India, according to \nthe Earth Policy Institute (Figure 15.22). However, in 2012, U.S. per capita emissions of CO\n2 were several times \nhigher than those of China and India.

According to a 2014 NAS report, such changes are likely to last for at least a thousand years beyond the 21st century.\nWhat Role Do the Oceans Play in Climate \nChange?\nThe world\u2019s oceans absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere as \npart of the carbon cycle and thus help to moderate the \nearth\u2019s average surface temperature and its climate. It is estimated that the oceans remove roughly 25% of the CO\n2 \npumped into the lower atmosphere by human activities. About 93% of it is then stored as carbon compounds in marine algae and vegetation and in coral reefs.\nThe oceans also absorb heat from the lower atmo-\nsphere. Indeed, an estimated 80\u201390% of the heat held in the lower atmosphere by greenhouse gases ends up in the ocean, according to NASA scientist Josh Willis. Then, partly driven by this heat, ocean currents slowly transfer some of the absorbed CO\n2 to the deep ocean (see Figure \n7.5, p. 133), where it is buried in carbon compounds in bottom sediments for several hundred million years. Thus, the average temperature of the oceans has also risen since 1970. However, because of their huge mass and volume, the oceans have warmed to a lesser degree and more slowly than the atmosphere has.\nThe uptake of CO\n2 and heat by the world\u2019s oceans has \nhelped to reduce the rate of climate change. However, this has resulted in the growing and serious problem of ocean acidification (see Science Focus 9.3, p. 206).\nCloud Cover Affects Atmospheric Warming\nWarmer temperatures increase evaporation of surface wa-ter, which raises the relative humidity of the atmosphere in various parts of the world. This creates more clouds that can either cool or warm the atmosphere. An increase in thick and continuous cumulus clouds at low altitudes (Fig-ure 15.23, left) could decrease surface warming by reflect-ing more sunlight back into space. But an increase in thin, wispy cirrus clouds at high altitudes (Figure 15.23, right) \ncould cause more warming of the lower atmosphere by preventing some heat from escaping into space.\nClimate modelers are working hard to understand \nmore about the role of clouds in their climate models and the causes of cloud formation. According to the 2014 NAS report on climate, the latest scientific research indicates that the net global effect of cloud cover changes is likely to increase atmospheric warming. We need more research in order to evaluate this effect.Outdoor Air Pollution Can Temporarily \nSlow Atmospheric Warming\nAccording to the 2014 IPCC report, there is evidence that \naerosol air pollution (suspended microscopic droplets and solid particles) from human activities has slowed the rate of atmospheric warming. These pollutants are released or formed in the troposphere by volcanic eruptions and by human activities (Figure 15.3). They can hinder or en-hance both the greenhouse effect and cloud formation, depending on factors such as their size and reflectivity.\nMost aerosols, such as light-colored sulfate particles \nproduced by fossil fuel combustion, tend to reflect incoming sunlight and cool the lower atmosphere. However, black carbon particles, or soot, also released by such combustion, absorb solar energy and warm the lower atmosphere.\nClimate scientists do not expect aerosols and soot \n particles to measurably counteract or enhance projected climate change resulting from greenhouse gas emissions in the next 50 years for two reasons. First, aerosols and soot \nfall back to the earth or are washed out of the lower atmo-sphere within weeks or months, whereas CO\n2 typically \nremains in the lower atmosphere for 100 years or longer.

They run these continually improving models on super -\ncomputers and compare the results to known past climate changes, from which they project future changes in the earth\u2019s average atmospheric temperature. Figure 15.A gives a greatly simplified summary of  \nsome of the key interactions in  \nthe global climate system.\nSuch models provide projections  \nof what is likely to happen to the average temperature of the lower atmosphere, based on available data and different assumptions about future changes such as CO\n2 \nand C h4 levels in the atmosphere. \nhow well these projections match \nwhat actually happens in the real world depends on the validity of the assumptions, what variables are built into the models, and the accuracy of the data used.\nRecall that while scientific re-\nsearch cannot give us absolute proof or certainty, it does provide us with varying levels of certainty. When most experts in a particular sci-entific field generally agree on a level of 90% certainty about a set of mea-surements or model results, they say that their projections are very likely to be correct; when the level of certainty reaches 95% (a rarity in science), they contend that their projections are ex-tremely likely to be correct.\n90446_ch15_386-427.indd   408 8/13/14   2:24 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This is indicated by the wide range of projected temperature changes in Figure 15.C and the range of the pro-jected rise in sea level (see Figure 16,  \np. S48, in Supplement 5).

What makes the current problem urgent is that we face a rapid projected increase in the average temperature of the \nlower atmosphere during your lifetime (Figure 15.C). This, in turn, is very likely to change the fairly mild climate that we have had for the past 10,000 years. According to the 2014 AAAS report on climate change, \u201cThe rate of climate change now may be as fast as any extended warming pe-riod over the past 65 million years, and is projected to in-crease in coming years.\u201d\nClimate models indicate that, in the worst-case scenario, \nrising atmospheric temperatures and concentrations of water vapor will likely lead to: rising sea levels that would flood many low-lying coastal cities (see chapter-opening photo); some forests being consumed in vast wildfires; some grasslands turning into dust bowls; some rivers dry-ing up; certain ecosystems collapsing; the extinction of at least a fourth and perhaps half of the world\u2019s species; more intense and longer-lasting heat waves; and more destruc-tive storms and flooding.\nThese effects will likely reduce food security and in-\ncrease poverty and social conflict in many poorer nations, such as Bangladesh\u2014countries that are typically the least responsible for atmospheric warming, as well as least able to protect themselves. The models indicate that we will have to deal simultaneously with many of these disruptive effects within this century\u2014an incredibly short time to bring about a major shift in the way we live and interact with our life-support system.\nLet\u2019s take a more in-depth look at some of these likely \nconsequences.\nMore Ice and Snow Are Likely to Melt\nModels project that climate change will be the most severe in the world\u2019s polar regions. Light-colored ice and snow in these regions help to cool the earth by reflecting incoming solar energy back into space\u2014a process called the albedo effect. The melting of such ice and snow exposes much darker land and sea areas, which reflect significantly less sunlight and absorb more solar energy. This has warmed the atmosphere above the poles more and faster than the atmosphere is warming at lower latitudes, as projected by all major climate models. The result is likely to be more melting of snow and ice, which will cause further atmo-spheric warming above the poles in an escalating spiral of change as part of a positive, runaway feedback loop (see Figure 2.11, p. 36).\nAccording to the 2014 IPCC report, arctic air tempera-\ntures have risen almost twice as fast as average tempera-tures in the rest of the world during the past 50 years, and they are now warmer than they have been in more than 44,000 years. Arctic ocean waters have also warmed. In addition, soot generated by North American, European, and Asian industries is darkening arctic ice and lessening its ability to reflect sunlight.\nMostly as a result of these factors, floating summer sea \nice in the Arctic is disappearing faster than scientists thought it would only a few years ago (Figure 15.24). Measurements indicate that the melting of this ice is due to both warmer air above the ice and warmer water below. Because of changes in short-term weather conditions, summer arctic sea ice coverage is likely to fluctuate.

This would open these waters to shipping and would allow ac-cess to oil and mineral deposits in the arctic region. How-ever, it could also lead to dramatic and long-lasting changes in weather and climate that could affect the whole planet.

If this continues, 53 million people in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador who rely on meltwater from the glaciers for irrigation and hydropower could at some point face severe water, power, and food shortages. In the United States, according to climate mod-els, people living in the Columbia, Sacramento, and Colo-rado River basins could face similar threats as the winter snowpack that feeds these rivers is projected to shrink by as much as 70% by 2050.Permafrost Is Likely to Melt: Another \nDangerous Scenario\nPermafrost occurs in soils found beneath about 25% of the \nexposed land in Alaska, Canada, and Siberia in the north-ern hemisphere. Huge amounts of carbon are locked up in permafrost soils.\nA 2012 report by the United Nations Environment Pro-\ngramme (UNEP) estimated that human-caused climate change is projected to thaw out significant amounts of permafrost, as is already happening in parts of Alaska and Siberia. If this trend continues, a great deal of organic ma-terial found below the permafrost will likely rot and re-lease huge amounts of CH\n4 and CO 2 into the atmosphere. \nThis would accelerate projected atmospheric warming, which would in turn melt more permafrost and lead to more atmospheric warming in yet another worsening spi-ral of change as part of a positive feedback loop.\nSome scientists are concerned about another methane \nsource\u2014a layer of permafrost on the Arctic Sea floor.

Natural cyclical processes also cause ex-treme droughts so a specific drought cannot be tied to atmospheric warming. However, the extra heat energy in the atmosphere evaporates water from soils. According to a 2014 study by climate scientists Richard Seager and Martin Hoerling, this depletion of soil moisture prolongs droughts and makes them more severe, regardless of their causes.\nWarming increases the kinetic energy in the atmo-\nsphere, and as a result, some areas will likely experience longer, more", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3230, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c834d1be-c7ff-4f48-b345-5f46e409742c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c834d1be-c7ff-4f48-b345-5f46e409742c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "412", "file_name": "G.

(See Figure 15 on p. S47 in Supplement 5 for graphs showing global changes in atmo-spheric temperature, atmospheric moisture, heat waves, and extreme rainfalls for the past several decades.)\nIn 2010, a World Meteorological Organization panel of \nexperts concluded that projected atmospheric warming is likely to lead to fewer but stronger hurricanes and ty-phoons that could cause more damage in coastal areas where urban populations have grown rapidly (see chapter-opening photo). However, climate scientists point out that while climate change is likely to increase the overall chances of extreme weather events over periods of 30 years or longer, there is not sufficient evidence to link any specific extreme weather event such as a heat wave, storm, hurricane, or typhoon to climate change.\nClimate Change Threatens Biodiversity\nAccording to the 2007 and 2014 IPCC reports, projected climate change is likely to alter ecosystems and take a toll on biodiversity in areas of every continent. For example, up to 85% of the Amazon rain forest\u2014one of the world\u2019s major centers of biodiversity\u2014could be lost and converted to tropical savanna if the global atmospheric temperature rises by the highest projected amount (Figure 15.C), ac-cording to a 2009 study led by Chris Jones.\nAs the atmosphere warms, 25\u201350% of the world\u2019s spe-\ncies could face extinction by 2100. The hardest hit will be cold-climate plant and animal species, including the polar bear in the Arctic and pen-guins in Antarctica; species that live at higher elevations; species with limited ranges such as some amphibians (see Chapter 4 Core Case Study,  \np. 64); and those with limited tolerance for temperature change, such as corals. The primary cause of such extinc-tions would be loss of habitat. On the other hand, the popu-lations of plant and animal \nspecies that thrive in warmer climates could grow.\nResearch indicates that the most vulnerable ecosys-\ntems are coral reefs, polar seas, coastal wetlands, high-elevation forests, and alpine and arctic tundra. Primarily because of drier conditions, forest fires will likely become more frequent and intense in some areas such as the southeastern and western United States. A warmer climate could also greatly increase populations of insects and fungi that damage trees, especially in the absence of winter weather cold enough to control their populations. Accord-ing to scientists, this helps to explain the recent severe damage to pine forests in Canada (Figure 15.27) and in the American West. Climate change is also threatening many existing state and national parks, wildlife reserves, wilder -\nness areas, and wetlands, along with much of the biodiver -\nsity they contain.\nFood Production Could Decline\nFarmers will face dramatic changes due to shifting climates and an intensified hydrologic cycle, if the atmosphere keeps warming as projected (Figure 15.C). According to the IPCC, crop productivity is projected to increase slightly at middle to high latitudes in areas such as midwestern Canada, Russia, and Ukraine, with moderate warming, but it will decrease if warming goes too far. However, the pro-jected rise in crop productivity might be limited because the soils in these northern regions generally lack sufficient plant nutrients.\nClimate change models project a decline in agricultural \nproductivity and food security in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in Southeast Asia and Central America. \nFIGURE 15.27   With warmer win-\nters, populations of mountain pine \nbeetles have exploded and killed large numbers of trees (orange ar -\neas in photo) in this lodgepole pine forest in the Canadian province of British Columbia.\nReproduced with permission from Natural Re-\nsources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, 2014\nLarge areas", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3997, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "deaf2250-7ab8-4c0e-be98-da3f4f6b9f37": {"__data__": {"id_": "deaf2250-7ab8-4c0e-be98-da3f4f6b9f37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "413", "file_name": "G.

This flooding could also affect fish production in coastal aquaculture ponds. Food production could also drop in farm regions that are dependent on rivers fed by melting glaciers, and in arid and semiarid areas where droughts become more prolonged.\nAccording to the IPCC, food is likely to be plentiful for \na while in a warmer world, because of the longer growing season in northern regions. But IPCC scientists warn that during the latter half of this century, several hundred mil-lion of the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people could face starvation and malnutrition due to a drop in food production caused by projected climate change.\nClimate Change Will Likely Threaten \nHuman Health, National Security,  and Economies\nAccording to IPCC and other reports, more frequent and pro-\nlonged heat waves in some areas will raise the numbers of deaths and illnesses, especially among older people, people in poor health, and the urban poor who cannot afford air con-ditioning. On the other hand, fewer people will die from cold weather. However, a study led by Mercedes Medina-Ramon of the Harvard University School of Public Health suggests that during the latter half of this century, the projected rise in the number of heat-related deaths will likely exceed the pro-jected drop in the number of cold-related deaths.\nA warmer and more CO\n2-rich atmosphere will likely fa-\nvor rapidly multiplying insects, including mosquitoes and ticks that transmit diseases such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease. Warming will also favor microbes, toxic molds, and fungi, as well as some plants that produce pollens that cause allergies and asthma attacks. Also, insect pests and weeds are likely to multiply, spread, and reduce crop yields. Microbes that cause infectious tropical diseases such as dengue fever and yellow fever could expand or at least shift their ranges and numbers if the mosquitoes that carry them spread to warmer temperate and higher elevation areas. But we need more research in order to establish this connection.\nIt is also likely that higher atmospheric temperatures \nand higher levels of water vapor in urban areas will con-tribute to heavier photochemical smog in such areas. This in turn will likely cause more pollution-related deaths and illnesses due to heart ailments and respiratory problems.\nRecent studies by the U.S. Department of Defense and \nthe National Academy of Sciences warn that climate change could affect U.S. national security. Likely effects include global geopolitical impacts that could contribute to increased food and water scarcity, poverty, environmental degradation, social unrest, mass migration of environmental refugees, po-litical instability, and the weakening of fragile governments.Climate change is also likely to take a toll on human \neconomies, although there is disagreement over the likely impact. Various economists estimate that the cost of pro-jected climate change, if current trends continue, would be 5% to 20% per year of the world\u2019s economic activity as measured by gross domestic output. Other researchers say the cost could be higher, because most models used to cal-culate such costs have not adequately accounted for eco-nomic losses from projected ocean acidification (see Science Focus 9.3, p. 206), rising sea levels, and biodiversity losses. Also, a growing number of economists and major multina-tional companies are recognizing that more drought, flood-ing, and extreme weather events are contributing to lower economic productivity, disruption of supply chains, higher costs for food and other commodities, and higher levels of financial risk for companies and investors.\n15.6 WHAT CAN WE", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3925, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f02b8d0-80a6-4da5-a0e6-96f3c81f240c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f02b8d0-80a6-4da5-a0e6-96f3c81f240c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "414", "file_name": "G.

But the following characteristics of this complex problem make it difficult to tackle:\n\u2022\tThe problem is global. Dealing with this threat will \nrequire unprecedented and prolonged international cooperation.\n\u2022\tThe problem is a long-term political issue. Climate change is now happening and is already having harmful impacts, but it is not viewed as an urgent problem by most voters and elected officials. And most of the people who will likely suffer the most serious harm from projected climate change during the latter half of this century have not yet been born.\n\u2022\tThe projected harmful and beneficial impacts of climate change are not spread evenly. For example, higher-latitude nations such as Canada, Russia, and New Zealand may temporarily have higher crop yields, fewer deaths in winter, and lower heating bills. But other, mostly poor nations such as Bangladesh could see more flooding and higher death tolls.\n\u2022\tProposed solutions, such as sharply reducing or phasing out the use of fossil fuels, are controversial because they could \n90446_ch15_386-427.indd   414 8/13/14   2:25 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Current climate models lead to a wide range in the projected temperature increase (Figure 15.C) and sea-level rise (Figure 16, p. S48, in Supplement 5). Thus, there is considerable uncertainty over whether the harmful changes will be moderate or catastrophic. This makes it difficult to plan for avoiding or managing risk, and it highlights the urgent need for more scientific research to reduce the uncertainty in climate models.\nThere are two basic approaches to dealing with the \nprojected harmful effects of global climate change. One, \ncalled mitigation, is to try to slow it down in order to avoid \nits most harmful effects. The other approach, called adapta-tion, is to recognize that our current failure to sharply re-duce our contribution to atmospheric warming means that some climate change is unavoidable and that we will now have to try to adapt to some of its harmful effects. Most analysts call for a combination of both approaches.\nRegardless of how we approach climate change, most \nclimate scientists argue that our most urgent priority is to avoid any and all climate change tipping points\u2014those estimated thresholds beyond which natural sys-tems could change irreversibly. Figure 15.28 lists some of the possible tipping points that climate scientists are most concerned about. For example, if we continue to add CO\n2 \nto the atmosphere at the current rate, we will likely ex-ceed the estimated tipping point marked by 450 ppm of atmospheric CO\n2 within a couple of decades. This would \nlikely lock in severe climate change for hundreds or per -\nhaps thousands of years and increase the likelihood of exceeding many of the other tipping points shown in Figure 15.28.\nWe Can Prevent and Control Greenhouse \nGas Emissions\nThe world\u2019s nations and energy companies combined hold \nreserves of fossil fuels that, if burned, would emit nearly five times the amount of CO\n2 that climate scientists say we \ncan safely emit. Currently, the economic well-being of the politically powerful fossil-fuel companies and most of the world\u2019s national economies depend on using all or most of these reserves of fossil fuels.\nEven if we could stop burning all fossil fuels tomorrow, \nthe amount of CO\n2 already in the atmosphere will very \nlikely continue to warm the earth for many decades be-cause it will remain in the atmosphere for at least 100 years. In other words, our fossil fuel\u2013driven civilization has very likely (with at least 90% certainty) irreversibly committed future generations to a warmer world with ris-ing seas and other harmful consequences\u2014a serious viola-tion of the ethical principle of sustainability (see \nSupplement 7, p. S51), which calls for us to leave the world in a condition as good as or better than what we inherited.\nA growing number of scientists and other analysts rec-\nognize that shifting away from our dependence on fossil fuels, especially abundant coal and oil, over the next 4 to 5 decades will be difficult but can be done. During the his-tory of human energy use, we shifted our dependence first from wood to coal, then to oil, and now to natural gas with each shift taking about 50 years. We now have the knowledge and ability to shift to a reliance on energy effi-ciency and renewable energy over the next 50 years. All we need is the political and ethical will to commit to and complete such a shift.\nSome scientists contend that we could get a jump on \nslowing atmospheric warming by focusing on black carbon (a component of soot) and methane emissions, because these chemicals are short-lived in the atmosphere, com-pared to CO\n2 emissions, and we have the technologies to \naccomplish such cuts fairly quickly.

Among these solutions are four major prevention strategies that, according to a 2010 NAS study and the 2014 IPCC report, could reduce human green-house gas emissions by 57\u201383% by 2050:\n1.\n Improve energy efficiency to reduce fossil fuel use, \nespecially the use of coal. This would also save consumers money.\n2.\n Shift from carbon-based fossil fuels to a mix of low-carbon renewable energy resources based on local and regional availability.\n3.\n Stop cutting down tropical forests and plant trees to help remove more CO\n2 from the atmosphere.\n4. Shift to more sustainable and climate-friendly food production (see Figure 10.27, p. 242).\n5.\n Work on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas and making them more adaptable to climate change.GOOD\nNEWSAccording to the 2014 IPCC report, there is much \ngood news related to dealing with the threat of cli-\nmate change:\n\u2022\t We\tknow\thow\tto\tengineer \tzero-carbon \tbuildings \t\nand how to reduce the carbon footprints of existing \nbuildings.\n\u2022\t If\twe\tincrease\tthe\tuse\tof\thybrid,\tplug-in\thybrid,\tand\t\nelectric cars, while charging their batteries only with electricity produced from renewable energy sources, we will greatly reduce the carbon footprints of motor vehicles.\n\u2022\t The\n\tshift\tto\trenewable \tenergy\tis\taccelerating \tas\tthe\t\nprices for electricity from low-carbon wind turbines and solar cells are falling very rapidly, and investments in these technologies are growing.\n\u2022\t If\n\twe\tact\tnow,\twe\thave\tinexpensive \tways\tto\tkeep\t\natmospheric concentrations of CO 2 below 450 ppm \nand the atmospheric temperature increase to no more than 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) above the preindustrial level. This would require reducing global consumption of goods and services during this century, but only by 0.06% per year, according to IPCC estimates. And it could result in major and widespread economic benefits in the form of new technologies, markets, and jobs.\nSome Promote Cleanup and \nGeoengineering Schemes to Ward Off Climate Change\nSome scientists and engineers want to use cleanup strate-\ngies for removing some of the CO 2 from the atmosphere or \nfrom smokestacks, and storing (sequestering) it in other parts of the environment. One such strategy, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), would remove some of the CO\n2 gas from smokestack emissions of coal-\nburning power and industrial plants or from the atmo-sphere, convert it to a liquid, and force it under pressure into underground storage sites (Figure 15.30).\nOne problem with CCS schemes is that, with current \ntechnology, they can remove only part of the CO\n2 from \nsmokestack emissions and the atmosphere, at great cost, and they would not address the massive amounts of CO\n2 \nfrom motor vehicle exhausts, food production, and the burning of forests. CCS schemes also require a lot of en-ergy, which could lead to greater use of fossil fuels and higher emissions of CO\n2 and other air pollutants. In addi-\ntion, the CO 2 that is removed would have to remain sealed \nfrom the atmosphere forever. Any large-scale leaks or a number of smaller continuous leaks could dramatically increase atmospheric warming in a very short time.\nSo far, the experimental projects for capturing CO\n2 \nhave not been very effective and have been quite costly. For example, the first large-scale plant designed to convert coal to gas and to capture 65% of the CO\n2 produced has \nSlowing Climate Change\nSequester CO2 by", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3648, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ebfdb18-9771-44b6-bc59-8e97b0f39af1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ebfdb18-9771-44b6-bc59-8e97b0f39af1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "416", "file_name": "G.

It will be one of the most expensive fossil-fuel plants ever built in the United States. Such high costs are making U.S. utilities reluctant to build CCS plants.\nOther approaches to cleaning up carbon, or sequester -\ning it, include planting large areas of trees and fertilizing the ocean with iron pellets to boost populations of phyto-plankton (a strategy that, preliminary experiments indi-cate, may not work very well and could disrupt marine ecosystems). These and other such strategies would have the aim of removing more CO\n2 from the atmosphere.\nOther strategies fall under the umbrella of geoengi-\nneering, or trying to manipulate certain natural condi-tions to help counter our enhancement of the greenhouse effect. Some of these proposals are shown in Figure 15.31. One such proposal calls for injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the incoming sunlight into space in order to slow the warming of the tropo-sphere. Other scientists have called for placing a series of giant mirrors in orbit above the earth to reflect incoming sunlight for the same purpose. Another scheme is to de-ploy a large fleet of computer-controlled ocean-going ships to inject saltwater high into the sky in order to make clouds whiter and more reflective.Some scientists reject the idea of launching sulfates into \nthe stratosphere as being too risky because of our limited knowledge about possible unknown effects. For example, if the sulfates reflected too much sunlight, they could reduce evaporation enough to alter global rainfall patterns and worsen the already dangerous droughts in Asia and Africa. Also, a 2008 study by atmospheric scientist Simone Tilmes indicated that chlorine released by reactions involved in this scheme could speed up the thinning of the earth\u2019s vital ozone layer (a problem that we discuss in Section 15.7).\nAccording to some scientists, a major problem with most \nof these technological fixes is that, if they succeed, they could be used to justify the continued rampant use of fossil fuels, and this would allow CO\n2 levels in the lower atmo-\nsphere to continue building and adding to the serious prob-lem of ocean acidification. In the long run, they might not succeed in slowing atmospheric warming, in which case, atmospheric temperatures will likely soar at a rapid rate and essentially ensure severe and irreversible climate change, as well as other possible unexpected harmful side effects.\nIn addition, thinking that we can use geoengineering \nschemes to slow or prevent climate change could seriously delay a shift from relying on nonrenewable fossil fuels to using improved energy efficiency and a mix of renewable \nCoal-burning power plant\nPipelines for\npumping CO2\nDepletedcoal bed\nSaltwater aquifer\nDepleted oiland gas /f_ield\nFIGURE 15.30   Some proposed carbon capture and storage (CCS) schemes for removing some of the \ncarbon dioxide from smokestack emissions and from the atmosphere and storing (sequestering) it in soil, \nplants, deep underground reservoirs, and sediments beneath the ocean floor.

This would help us to include the estimated harmful environmental and health costs of using fossil fuels in fuel prices, in keeping with the full-cost pricing principle of sustainabil-ity.

The first phase of the resulting Kyoto Protocol went into effect in Febru-ary 2005 with 187 of the world\u2019s 194 countries (not includ-ing the United States) ratifying the agreement by late 2009.\nThe 36 participating more-developed countries agreed \nto cut their emissions of CO\n2, CH 4, and N 2O to certain lev-\nels by 2012, when the treaty was to expire, but they failed to do so. Less-developed countries, including China, were excused from this requirement, because such reductions would curb their economic growth. In 2005, participating countries began negotiating a second phase of the treaty, \nCarbon and Energy Taxes\nTax laws", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3627, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caf727b5-a791-4020-bdd1-2f723654f6f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "caf727b5-a791-4020-bdd1-2f723654f6f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "419", "file_name": "G.

Negotiators hope to reach an agreement in 2015 that would go into effect in 2020. Some analysts see top-down international climate agreements as weak, slow, and inef-fective responses to an urgent global problem.\nSome Countries, States, Cities, and Private \nCompanies Are Leading the Way in Reducing Carbon Footprints\nSome nations are leading others in facing the challenges of \nprojected climate change. Costa Rica aims to be the first country to become carbon neutral by cutting its net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. The country generates 78% of its electricity with renewable hydroelectric power and an-other 18% from renewable wind and geothermal energy.\nSome U.S. state and local governments are moving \nahead in dealing with climate change, not waiting for the U.S. federal government, which has acted slowly in this arena. By 2014, at least 30 U.S. states had set goals for reduc-ing greenhouse gas emissions. California plans to get 33% of its electricity from low-carbon renewable energy sources by 2030. That state is showing that it is possible to implement policies that cut carbon emissions and create jobs. Since 1990, local governments in more than 650 cities around the world (including more than 450 U.S. cities) have estab-lished programs to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\nLeaders of some big U.S. companies, including Alcoa, \nDuPont,\n\tFord\tMotor\tCompany, \tGeneral\tElectric,\tJohnson \t\n& Johnson, PepsiCo, and Shell Oil, have joined with lead-ing environmental organizations to form the U.S. Climate Action Partnership. Each is working on reducing its carbon footprint, and such actions will reduce their contributions to climate change while saving them money. For example, between 1990 and 2006, DuPont slashed its energy usage and cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 72% and saved $3 billion, while the company grew its business by almost a third. These companies have called on the government to enact strong national climate change legislation, saying, \u201cIn our view, the climate change challenge will create more economic opportunities than risks for the U.S. economy.\u201d\nColleges and Universities Are Reducing \nTheir Carbon Footprints\nMany colleges and universities are also taking action. Arizona \nState University (ASU) boasts the largest collection of solar panels of any U.S. university. ASU was also the first U.S. uni-versity to establish a School of Sustainability. The College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, has been carbon neutral since 2007. It gets all of its electricity from renewable hydro-power, and many of its buildings are heated with the use of renewable wood pellets. Students there built a wind turbine that powers a nearby organic farm, which offers organic pro-duce to the campus, to local schools, and to food banks.Students at the University of Washington in Seattle agreed \nto an increase in their fees to help the school buy electricity from renewable energy sources. At Florida\u2019s University of Mi-ami, drivers of hybrid cars get a 50% parking discount. At Texas A & M University, used cooking oil from the cafeteria is converted to biofuel for the school\u2019s delivery trucks.\nEARTH University in Costa Rica has a mission to pro-\nmote sustainable development in tropical countries. Its sustainable agriculture degree program has attracted stu-dents from more than 20 different countries. And a grow-ing number of campus groups are urging the administrators at their schools to help slow climate change by ending their endowment fund investments in fossil fuel companies.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT What Your School Can Do\nWhat are three steps that you think your school should take to help reduce its \ncarbon footprint?\nEvery Individual Choice Makes a", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3909, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d118555-44a3-4aa6-8d46-da433d342b6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d118555-44a3-4aa6-8d46-da433d342b6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "420", "file_name": "G.

In anticipation of rising sea levels, Boston has elevated one of its sewage treatment plants. And some cities plan to establish cooling centers to shelter residents during increasingly intense heat waves.

For example, the band Coldplay offset the amount of CO\n2 emitted for the production of one of their \nCDs by providing 10,000 CO 2-absorbing mango trees to \nsome villages in India. Figure 15.34 lists some ways in which you can cut your CO\n2 emissions while increasing \nyour beneficial environmental impact.\nWe Can Prepare for Climate Change\nAccording to global climate models, the world needs to make a 50\u201385% cut in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 to stabilize concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere. This would help to prevent the atmosphere from warming by more than 2C\u00b0 (3.6F\u00b0) and it would head off rapid changes in the world\u2019s climate along with the harmful environmental, economic, and health effects that are projected to result.\nHowever, because of the political difficulty of making \nsuch large reductions, many analysts believe that while we work to slash greenhouse gas emissions, we should also begin to prepare for the likely harmful effects of projected climate change. Figure 15.35 shows some ways to do so.\nFor example, relief organizations such as the Interna-\ntional Red Cross are turning their attention to projects such as expanding mangrove forests as buffers against storm surges, building shelters on high ground, and plant-ing trees on slopes to help prevent landslides in the face of \n90446_ch15_386-427.indd   421 8/13/14   2:25 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In other words, the ozone layer in the stratosphere is a vital form of natu-ral capital that supports all life on land and in shallow aquatic environments.\nHowever, measurements taken by researchers show a \nconsiderable seasonal depletion, or thinning, of ozone concentrations in the stratosphere above Antarctica (Fig-ure 15.36) and above the Arctic since the 1970s. Similar measurements reveal more slight overall ozone thinning everywhere except over the tropics. The loss of ozone over Antarctica has been called an ozone hole. A more accurate term is ozone thinning because the ozone depletion varies with altitude and location.\nBased on these measurements and on mathematical \nand chemical models, the overwhelming consensus of re-\n0 100 200 300\nTotal Ozone (Dobson units)400 500 600 700\nFIGURE 15.36   Natural capital degradation: This colorized satellite \nimage shows ozone thinning over Antarctica during September of \n2013.

Chemists soon developed similar \ncompounds to create a family of highly useful CFCs, \nknown by their trade name Freons. These chemically \nunreactive, odorless, nonflammable, nontoxic, and \nnoncorrosive compounds seemed to be dream \nchemicals. Inexpensive to manufacture, they be-came popular as coolants in air conditioners and refrigerators, propellants in aerosol spray cans, \ncleansers for electronic parts such as computer \nchips, fumigants for granaries and ships\u2019 cargo holds, \nand gases used to make insulation and packaging.\nIt turned out that CFCs were too good to be true. \nStarting in 1974 with the work of chemists Sherwood \nRowland and Mario Molina (Individuals Matter 15.1), sci-\nentists demonstrated that CFCs are persistent chemicals that \n destroy protective ozone in the stratosphere. Satellite data and other measurements and models indicate that 75\u201385% of the observed ozone losses in the stratosphere since 1976 resulted from people releasing CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals into the troposphere beginning in the 1950s. After entering the troposphere these long-lived chem-icals eventually reached the stratosphere, where they began destroying ozone faster than it was being formed by the in-teraction of stratospheric oxygen and incoming solar radia-tion\u2014a disruption of one of the earth\u2019s most important forms of natural capital. While in the troposphere, CFCs also act as greenhouse gases that help to warm the lower atmosphere.\nWhy Should We Worry about  \nOzone Depletion?\nWhy is ozone depletion something that should concern \nus? Figure 15.37 lists some of the demonstrated effects of stratospheric ozone thinning. One effect is that more bio-logically damaging UV-A and UV-B radiation will reach the earth\u2019s surface (Concept 15.7A) and is a likely contributor to rising numbers of eye cataracts, damaging sunburns, and skin cancers.

However, models and measurements indicate that even with immediate and sustained action, it will take at least 60 years for the earth\u2019s ozone layer to recover the levels of ozone it had in 1980, and it could take about 100 years for it to recover to pre-1950 levels.\nIn 1987, representatives of 36 nations met in Montreal, \nCanada, and developed the Montreal Protocol. This treaty\u2019s goal was to cut emissions of CFCs (but no other ozone-depleting chemicals) by about 35% between 1989 and 2000. After hearing more bad news about seasonal ozone thinning above Antarctica in 1989, representatives of 93 countries had more meetings and in 1992 adopted the Co-penhagen Amendment, which accelerated the phase-out of CFCs and added some other key ozone-depleting chemi-cals to the agreement.\nThese international agreements set an important prec-\nedent because nations and companies worked together, using a prevention approach to try to solve a serious envi-ronmental problem. This approach worked for three rea-sons. First, there was convincing and dramatic scientific \nevidence of a serious problem. Second, CFCs were pro-duced by a small number of international companies and this meant there was less corporate resistance to finding a solution. Third, the certainty that CFC sales would decline \nover a period of years because of government bans un-\nindividuals matter 15.1 \nSherwood Rowland and Mario Molina\u2014A Scientific Story of \nExpertise, Courage, and Persistence\nIn 1974, calculations by the late Sherwood Rowland (top photo) and Mario Molina (bottom \nphoto), chemists at the University of California\u2013Irvine, indicated that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were lowering the average concentration of ozone in the stratosphere. These scien-tists decided they had an ethical obligation to go public with the results of their research. They shocked both the scientific community and the $28-billion-per-year CFC industry by call -\ning for an immediate ban of CFCs in spray cans, for which substitutes were available.\nThe research of these two scientists led them to four major conclusions. \nFirst,  once CFCs \nare put into the atmosphere, these persistent chemicals remain there for a long time.\nSecond,  over 11\u201320 years, these compounds rise into the stratosphere through convec-\ntion, random drift, and the turbulent mixing of air in the lower atmosphere.\nThird,  once they reach the stratosphere, the CFC molecules break down under the influ-\nence of high-energy UV radiation. This releases highly reactive chlorine atoms (Cl), as well as \natoms of fluorine (F) and bromine (Br), all of which accelerate the breakdown of ozone (O 3) \ninto O 2 and O in a cyclic chain of chemical reactions. As a consequence, ozone is destroyed \nfaster than it forms in some parts of the stratosphere.\nFourth,  each CFC molecule can last in the stratosphere for 65\u2013385 years, depending on its \ntype. During that time, each chlorine atom released during the breakdown of CFCs can break down hundreds of O\n3 molecules.\nThe CFC industry (led by DuPont) was a powerful, well-funded adversary with a lot of \nprofits and jobs at stake. It attacked Rowland\u2019s and Molina\u2019s calculations and conclusions, but the two researchers held their ground, expanded their research, and explained their re-sults to other scientists, elected officials, and the media.

Scientists from Johns Hop-kins University reported in 2009 that tropospheric warm-ing makes the stratosphere cooler, which slows down its rate of ozone repair. Thus, as the troposphere warms and the global climate changes, ozone levels may take much longer to return to where they were before ozone thinning began, or they may never recover completely. In 2012, Harvard\n\tUniversity \tchemist\tJames\tG.\tAnderson \tand\this\t\ncolleagues suggested that updrafts from large and more intense thunderstorms resulting from projected climate change could inject water vapor into the stratosphere (which is normally drier than a desert).

This has contributed to increased atmospheric warming, which in turn is projected to result in possibly dis-ruptive climate change during this century.\nThe effects of climate change could include rapid melting \nof land-based ice (Core Case Study) and arctic sea ice, worsen-ing drought, rising sea levels, declining biodiversity, and se-vere threats to human health and economies. Many of these effects could further accelerate climate change in worsening spirals of change. We have also seen how the widespread use of certain chemicals has thinned the stratospheric ozone layer, which has led to plant and animal health problems.\nWe can apply the six principles of sustainability (see \nSupplement 7, pp. S50\u2013S51) to help reduce the harmful \n effects of air pollution, projected climate change, and  \nstratospheric ozone depletion. We can reduce emissions  \nof pollutants, greenhouse gases, and ozone-depleting chemi-cals by relying more on direct and indirect forms of solar en-ergy than on fossil fuels; recycling and reusing matter resources much more widely than we do now; and mimicking biodiversity by using a variety of often locally available low-carbon renewable energy resources in place of fossil fuels and nuclear power. We can advance toward these goals by includ-ing the harmful environmental and health costs of fossil fuel use in market prices; seeking win-win solutions that will ben-efit both the economy and the environment; and giving high priority to passing along to future generations an environ-ment in which they too can thrive.TyING IT ALL T OGETHER\nMelting Ice in Greenland and Sustainability\nJan Martin Will/Shutterstock.com\n90446_ch15_386-427.indd   425 8/13/14   2:25 PMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

It is the fastest-growing solid waste problem in the United States and in the world.\nOnly about 14% of all U.S. \ne-waste is recycled. Most of the rest of it ends up in landfills and incinera-tors, even though many of the com-ponents in electronic devices contain gold, rare earths (see Chapter 12, Core Case Study, p. 290), and other valuable materials that could be \n recycled or reused. E-waste is also a source of toxic and hazardous chemi-cals that can contaminate air, surface water, groundwater, and soil and cause human health problems.\nMuch of the e-waste in the  \nUnited States that is not buried or incinerated is shipped to China  \n(Figure 16.1), India, and other Asian and African countries where labor is cheap and environmental regulations are weak. Workers there\u2014many of them children\u2014dismantle, burn, and treat e-waste products with acids  \nto recover valuable metals and reus-able parts. As they do this, they are exposed to toxic metals such as lead and mercury and other harmful  \nchemicals. The remaining scrap is dumped into waterways and fields  \nor burned in open fires, exposing many people to highly toxic chemicals called dioxins. So by discarding a cell phone or other electronic device in  \nthe United States, one can contribute to health problems for people in China, India, or Africa.\nTransfer of such hazardous waste \nfrom more-developed to less-developed countries was banned by the International Basel Convention, a treaty designed to reduce and control the movement of hazardous waste across international borders. Despite this ban, much of the world\u2019s e-waste is not officially classified as hazardous waste, or it is illegally smuggled out of some countries. The United States can export its e-waste legally because it is the only industrialized nation that has not ratified the Basel Convention.\nThe European Union (EU) has led \nthe way in dealing with e-waste by requiring manufacturers to take back electronic products at the end of their useful lives and repair, remanufacture, or recycle them. In the EU, e-waste is banned from landfills and incinerators. Japan is also taking this approach. To cover the costs of these programs, consumers pay a recycling tax on elec-tronic products, an example of imple-menting the full-cost pricing  \nprinciple of sustainability.  However, because of the high costs involved in complying with these laws, much of this waste that is supposed to be recycled domestically is shipped illegally to other countries.\nElectronic waste is just one of \nmany types of solid and hazardous waste that we discuss in this chapter.E-Waste\u2014An Exploding Problem\n430 \nPeter Essick/National Geographic Creative\nFIGURE 16.1   Workers in Taizhou City  \nin China\u2019s Zhejiang Province are recover-  \ning valuable materials from scrapped com-\nputers shipped from the United States.  \nQuestions: Have you disposed of an electronic device lately?

Studies and experi-ence indicate that by mimicking nature, we could reduce this waste of potential resources and the resulting environmental harm by up to 80%.\nIn their 2013 book, The Upcycle, William McDonough \nand Michael Braungart call for us to think of solid wastes and pollution as potentially useful and economically valu-able materials and chemicals. In other words, instead of asking \u201cHow do I get rid of these wastes?\u201d they say we need to ask: \u201cHow much money can I get for these re-sources?\u201d and \u201cHow can I design products that don\u2019t end up as wastes or pollutants?\u201d This means designing prod-ucts so that they can be recycled or reused, much like nutrients in the biosphere, in keeping with the chemical cycling principle of sustainability. With this ap-\nproach we would think of trash cans and garbage trucks as resource containers. This is an important way to increase our beneficial environmental impact.\nOne major category of waste is solid waste\u2014any un-\nwanted or discarded material we produce that is not a liquid or a gas. Solid waste can be divided into two types. One type is industrial solid waste produced by mines (see Figure 12.8, p. 297), farms, and industries that supply people with goods and services. The other is municipal solid waste (MSW), often called garbage or trash, which consists of the combined solid wastes produced by homes and workplaces other than factories. Examples include paper and cardboard, food wastes, cans, bottles, yard wastes, furniture, plastics, metals, glass, wood, and e-waste (Core Case Study). Some resource experts suggest that we  change the name of the trash we produce from MSW to MWR\u2014mostly wasted resources.\nIn more-developed countries, most MSW is buried in \nlandfills or burned in incinerators. In many less-developed GOOD\nNEWScountries, much of it ends up in open dumps, where poor \npeople eke out a living finding items they can use or sell. The United States is the world\u2019s largest producer of MSW (see the following Case Study).\nCASE STUDY\nSolid Waste in the United States\nThe United States leads the world in total solid waste pro-duction and in solid waste per person. With only 4.5% of the world\u2019s people, the United States produces about 25% of the world\u2019s solid waste. According to the U.S. Environ-mental Protection Agency (EPA), about 98.5% of all solid waste produced in the United States is industrial solid waste from mining (76%), agriculture (13%), and industry (9.5%). The remaining 1.5% of U.S. solid waste is MSW.\nEvery year, the United States generates enough MSW \nto fill a bumper-to-bumper convoy of garbage trucks long enough to encircle the earth\u2019s equator almost six times.

This approach begins with the question, \u201cWhat do we do with solid waste?\u201d It typically involves mixing wastes together and then usually burying them, burning them, or shipping them to another loca-tion. The second approach is waste reduction, in which we produce much less solid waste, and the wastes we do produce are considered to be potential resources that we can reuse, recycle, or compost (Concept 16.2). This waste prevention approach begins with the question, \u201cHow can we avoid producing so much solid waste?\u201dMost analysts call for using integrated waste man-\nagement\u2014a variety of coordinated strategies for both waste disposal and waste reduction (Figure 16.4). Figure 16.5 compares the science-based waste management goals of the EPA and National Academy of Sciences with waste management trends based on an analysis of actual waste data by Columbia University and BioCycle researchers.\nSome scientists and economists estimate that we could \neliminate up to 80% of the solid waste we produce by rig -\norously applying the strategies shown in Figure 16.5 (left), thereby mimicking the earth\u2019s chemical cycling principle of sustainability. Let us look more closely at these op-tions in the order of priorities suggested by scientists.\nWe Can Cut Solid Wastes by Refusing, \nReducing, Reusing, and Recycling\nWaste reduction (Concept 16.2) is based on the four Rs of \nresource use:\n\u2022\tRefuse: Don\u2019t use it.\n\u2022\tReduce: Use less.\n\u2022\tReuse: Use it over and over.\n\u2022\tRecycle: Convert used resources to useful items and \nbuy products made from recycled materials.\nLandfill IncineratorRemaining\nmixed waste\nTo manufacturers for reuse or\nfor re cycling\nFertilizerCompostHazardous waste\nmanagementHazardous waste Plastic Glass PaperFood/yard\nwasteSolid and hazardous\nwastes generated during\nthe manufacturing processWaste generated by  \nhouseholds and\nbusinessesProductsProcessing and\nmanufacturingRaw mater ials\nMetal\u00a9 2016 Cengage LearningFIGURE 16.4   We can reduce wastes by refusing or reducing \nresource use and by reusing, recycling, and composting what \nwe discard, or we can manage them by burying them in land-fills or incinerating them.

Recycling is important but it deals with wastes after they have been produced. By refusing, reducing, reusing, recycling, and composting, we save matter and energy resources, reduce pollution (in-cluding greenhouse gas emissions), help protect biodiver -\nsity, and save money. Figure 16.6 lists some ways in which you can use the four Rs of waste reduction to reduce your output of solid waste.\nHere are six strategies that industries and communities \nhave used to reduce resource use, waste, and pollution.\nFirst, change industrial processes to eliminate or reduce the \nuse of harmful chemicals. Since 1975, the 3M Company has taken this approach and, in the process, saved $1.2 billion (see Chapter 14, Case Study, p. 376).Second, redesign manufacturing processes and products to \nuse less material and energy. For example, the weight of a typical car has been reduced by about one-fourth since the 1960s through the use of lighter steel, aluminum, and lightweight plastics and composite materials.\nThird, develop products that are easy to repair, reuse, re-\nmanufacture, compost, or recycle. For example, Xerox photo-copiers that are leased by businesses are made of reusable or recyclable parts that allow for easy remanufacturing and are projected to save the company $1 billion in manu-facturing costs.\nFourth, eliminate or reduce unnecessary packaging. Use the \nfollowing hierarchy for product packaging: no packaging, reusable packaging, and recyclable packaging.\nFifth, use fee-per-bag waste collection systems that charge \nconsumers for the amount of waste they throw away but provide free pickup of recyclable and reusable items.\nSixth, pass laws that require companies to take back \nvarious consumer products such as electronic equipment (Core Case Study), appliances, and motor vehicles, as Ja-\npan and many European countries do, for recycling or remanufacturing.\nSolid Waste\n/uni25A0 Follow the four Rs of resource use: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\n/uni25A0 Ask yourself whether you really need what you\u2019re buying and refuse packaging wherever possible\n/uni25A0 Rent, borrow, or barter goods and services when you can, buy secondhand, and donate or sell unused \nitems\n/uni25A0 Buy things that are reusable, recyclable, or compostable, and be sure to reuse, recycle, and compost them/uni25A0 Buy products with little or no packaging and recycle any packaging as much as possible/uni25A0 Avoid disposables such as paper and plastic bags, plates, cups, and utensils, disposable diapers, and \ndisposable razors whenever reusable versions are available\n/uni25A0 Cook with whole, fresh foods, avoid heavily packaged processed foods, and buy products in bulk \nwhenever possible\n/uni25A0 Discontinue junk mail as much as possible and read online newspapers and magazines and e-booksWhat Can You Do?FIGURE 16.6   Individuals \nmatter: You can save re-\nsources and money by reduc-ing your output of solid waste and pollution.

However, by applying the four Rs, we can slow or stop this trend.\nRefusing to buy some things, especially those with a \nsignificant environmental impact, is one way to use re-sources more sustainably. It begins by asking important questions such as: \u201cDo I really need this piece of clothing or this electronic gadget? Do I really need to replace my mobile phone, computer, or other electronic device just because a newer model has come out?\u201d\nReducing is the next level of using resources more sus-\ntainably. It means buying less, and involves asking ques-tions such as: \u201cHow many pairs of shoes or pants or how many blouses or skirts do I need? How many electronic devices do I need?\u201d\nThe third level of more sustainable resource use is re-\nuse. It involves cleaning and using items such as containers (Figure 16.7), dishes, utensils, and razor blades over and over, and thus increasing the typical life span of such prod-ucts. This form of waste reduction decreases the use of matter and energy resources, cuts waste and pollution (including greenhouse gas emissions), creates local jobs, and helps us to save money and expand our beneficial environmental impacts (Concept 16.3).\nFinally, the fourth level of more sustainable resource \nuse, recycling and composting, involves converting used \nitems and materials to other useful forms. It requires more energy and cuts waste and pollution to a lesser extent than does reuse of used items.\nReuse is on the rise. For example, many coffee \nshops are reducing waste and cutting their costs by discounting their hot drink prices for customers who bring their own refillable containers (Figure 16.7, right). Den-mark, Finland, and the Canadian province of Prince Ed-ward Island have banned all beverage containers that cannot be reused. In Finland, 95% of all soft drink, beer, wine, and spirits containers are refillable. The use of re-chargeable batteries is cutting toxic waste by reducing the amount of conventional batteries that are thrown away. The newest rechargeable batteries come fully charged, can \nGOOD\nNEWShold a charge for up to 2 years when not in use, and can \nbe recharged in about 15 minutes.\nThe single-use plastic bag is a highly visible symbol of \nthe throwaway mentality. Globally, about 2 million of such bags are used every minute, on average. Most of them end up littering the land or surface waters and endangering wildlife. Laid end-to-end, the 100 billion plastic bags used in the United States each year would reach to the moon and back about 60 times.\nInstead of using throwaway paper or plastic bags to \ncarry home groceries and other purchased items, many people have switched to reusable cloth bags. Both paper and plastic bags are environmentally harmful, and the question of which is more damaging has no clear-cut an-swer. In many countries, the landscape is littered with plastic bags.

These wastes, mostly small particles floating on or just beneath the ocean\u2019s surface and known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, are trapped there by a vortex where four rotating ocean currents called gyres meet (Figure 16.9).\nRoughly 80% of this trash (much of it plastic \nbags and bottles) comes from the land\u2014washed or blown off beaches, pouring out of storm drains, and floating down streams and rivers that empty into the sea from the west coast of North America, the east coast of Asia, and hundreds of Pacific islands. Most of the rest is dumped into the ocean from cargo and cruise ships.\nAccording to some estimates, the North \nPacific Garbage Patch occupies an area at least the size of Texas. However, such estimates are difficult to verify because this plastic-laden soup consists mostly of small particles of plastic sus-pended slightly underwater, and thus it is difficult to see and measure.\nResearch shows that the tiny plastic particles can be \nharmful to marine mammals, to some seabirds such as al-batrosses, and to some fishes and other aquatic species that mistake them for food and swallow them. Because these animals cannot digest the plastic, it can cause them to die from starvation, poisoning, or choking.\nBrenda Carson/Shutterstock.comFIGURE 16.8   Individuals matter: Ways to reuse the items \nwe purchase.

Their goal was to develop a commercial process for recycling high-value plastics from complex streams of manufactured goods such as computers, electronics, appliances, and automobiles. They succeeded by designing a 16-step automated process that separates plastics from nonplastic items in mixed waste streams, and then separates plastics from each other by type and grade. The pro-cess then converts them to pellets that can be sold and used to make new products.\nThe pellets are cheaper than virgin plastics because the company\u2019s process uses 90% \nless energy than that needed to make a new plastic and because the raw material is dis-carded junk that is cheap or free. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions from this recy-cling process are much lower than those from the process of making virgin plastics. And recycling plastic wastes reduces the need to incinerate them or bury them in landfills.\nMBA Polymers has been selected by \nInc. magazine as one of \u201c America\u2019s Most Inno-\nvative Companies.\u201d Biddle has been named a Technology Pioneer by the World Economic Forum and has received some of the world\u2019s most important environmental awards.\nBackground photo: justasc/Shutterstock.com\nMike Biddle\nWho is to blame for the garbage patches? Each of us \nrisks making a contribution every time we use and discard \na plastic item. We may think we have simply thrown it away. But there is no away.\nUnfortunately, there is no practical or affordable way \nto clean up this mess that we have created through throw-away habits. All we can do is to prevent the garbage patches from growing larger, and the only way to do this is to reduce our output of wastes by practicing the four Rs of resource use.\nThere Is Great Potential for Recycling\nHouseholds and workplaces produce five major types of materials that can be recycled: paper products, glass, alu-minum, steel, and some plastics. We can reprocess such materials into new, useful products in two ways. In pri-mary, or closed-loop, recycling, materials such as alu-\nminum cans are recycled into new products of the same type. In secondary recycling, waste materials are con-verted to different products.\nRecycling involves three steps: the collection of materi-\nals for recycling, the conversion of recycled materials to new products, and the selling and buying of products that contain recycled material. Recycling does not work unless all three of these steps are taken consistently.\nAccording to Columbia University researchers and Bio-\ncycle magazine, the United States recycles or composts about 24% of its MSW (lower than the EPA estimate of about 34%). This includes the recycling of about 96% of all lead-acid batteries, 72% of all newspapers, directories, and newspaper inserts, 67% of all steel cans, and 50% of all discarded aluminum cans. Other categories such as food waste and plastics have much lower recycling rates. Experts say that with education and proper incentives, Americans could recycle and compost at least 80% of their MSW, in keeping with the chemical cycling princi-ple of sustainability.\nCurrently, only about 7% by weight of all plastic \nwastes in the United States (and 13% of plastic containers and packaging) is recycled. These percentages are low be-cause there are many different types of plastic resins, which are difficult to separate from products that contain them. However, progress is being made in the recycling of plastics (Individuals Matter 16.1) and in the development of more degradable bioplastics (Science Focus 16.1).\nComposting is another form of recycling that mimics na-\nture\u2019s recycling of", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3811, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e2b4763-06ff-4c46-8a8b-8cbd1846e64c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e2b4763-06ff-4c46-8a8b-8cbd1846e64c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "437", "file_name": "G.

This may change as scientists shift to developing plastics made from biologically based chemicals.\nHenry Ford, who developed the first \nFord car and founded Ford Motor Company, supported research on the development of a bioplastic made from soybeans and another made from hemp. A 1914 photograph shows him using an ax to strike the body of a Ford car made from soy bioplastic to demonstrate its strength and resistance to denting.However, as oil became widely \navailable, petrochemical plastics took over the market. Now, with projected climate change and other environmen-tal problems associated with the use of oil, chemists are stepping up efforts to make biodegradable and more envi-ronmentally sustainable plastics. These bioplastics can be made from corn, soy, sugarcane, switchgrass, chicken feathers, and some components of garbage.\nCompared to conventional oil-based \nplastics, properly designed bioplastics \nBIOPLASTICS\nare lighter, stronger, and cheaper, and the process of making them requires less energy and produces less pollution per unit of weight. Instead of being sent to landfills, some packaging made from bioplastics can be composted to produce a soil conditioner, in keeping with the chemical cycling princi- ple of sustainability.\nCritical Thinking\nWhat might be some disadvantages of bioplastics? Do you think they out-weigh the advantages?ScienceFocus16.1\nCritics of recycling programs argue that recycling is \ncostly and adds to the taxpayer burden in communities \nwhere recycling is funded through taxation. They say that recycling may make economic sense for valuable and easy-to-recycle materials in MSW such as paper and paper -\nboard, steel, and aluminum, but probably not for cheap or plentiful resources such as glass.\nProponents of recycling point to studies showing that \nthe net economic, health, and environmental benefits of recycling (Figure 16.11, left) far outweigh the costs. For example, the EPA estimates that recycling and compost-ing in the United States in 2010 reduced emissions of climate-changing carbon dioxide by an amount roughly equal to that emitted by 36 million passenger vehicles. Recycling, reuse, and composting create 6\u201310 times as many jobs as landfills and waste incineration. The U.S. recycling industry employs about 1.1 million people, and doubling the U.S. recycling rate would create about 1 mil-lion new jobs.\nCities that make money by recycling and that have \nhigher recycling rates tend to use a single-pickup system for both recyclable and nonrecyclable materials, instead of a more expensive dual-pickup system. Successful systems also tend to use a pay-as-you-throw approach that charges for picking up trash but not for picking up recyclable or reusable materials, and they require citizens and busi-nesses to sort their trash and recyclables by type. San Francisco, California, uses such a system, and in 2012, the city recycled, composted, or reused 78% of its MSW.decompose yard trimmings, vegetable food scraps, and other biodegradable organic wastes. The resulting organic material can be added to soil to supply plant nutrients, slow soil ero-sion, retain water, and improve crop yields. Homeowners can compost such wastes in simple backyard containers, in composting piles that must be turned over occasionally, or in small composting drums that can be rotated to mix the wastes and speed up the decomposition process.\nSome cities in Canada and in many European Union \ncountries collect and compost 85% or more of their biode-gradable wastes in centralized community facilities. In the United States in 2013, at least 25 states had some version of a ban on yard wastes in sanitary landfills, and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3824, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15b40251-c970-4a44-b781-d9660e4f6d0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "15b40251-c970-4a44-b781-d9660e4f6d0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "438", "file_name": "G.

There are 115 \nof these incinerators in the United States, according to Columbia University and BioCycle researchers.\nThe United States incinerates about 9% of its MSW. \nOne reason for this fairly low percentage is that incinera-tion has a bad reputation stemming from past use of highly polluting and poorly regulated incinerators. Also, incinera-tion competes with an abundance of low-cost landfills in many parts of the country. By contrast, Denmark inciner -\nates 54% of its MSW in state-of-the-art waste-to-energy incinerators that exceed European air pollution standards by a factor of 10. A 2009 EPA study concluded that land-fills emit more air pollutants than modern waste-to-energy incinerators. On the other hand, the resulting incinerator ash contains toxic chemicals that still have to be stored somewhere.\nMany U.S. citizens, local governments, and environ-\nmental scientists oppose waste incineration because it undermines efforts to increase reuse and recycling by cre-ating a demand for burnable wastes and making it easier for consumers to discard reusable and recyclable items.

Question: Some experts say that these landfills will eventually develop leaks and could emit toxic liquids. How do you think this could happen?\n\u00a9 2016 Cengage Learning\nBurying Solid Waste Has Advantages  \nand Disadvantages\nIn the United States, about 67% of all MSW, by weight, is \nburied in sanitary landfills, compared to 80% in Canada, 15% in Japan, and 4% in Denmark. There are two types of landfills. In newer landfills, called sanitary landfills (Fig-ure 16.14), solid wastes are spread out in thin layers, com-pacted, and covered daily with a fresh layer of clay or plastic foam. This process helps to keep the material dry, reduces leakage of contaminated water (leachate) from the landfill, lessens the risk of fire, decreases odors, and reduces accessibility to the landfill for rats and other vermin.\nThe bottoms and sides of well-designed sanitary land-\nfills have strong double liners and containment systems that collect the liquids leaching from them. Some landfills also have systems for collecting methane, the potent greenhouse gas that is produced when the wastes decom-pose in the absence of oxygen, and burning it as a fuel. Figure 16.15 lists the advantages and disadvantages of us-ing sanitary landfills to dispose of solid waste.\nThe second type of landfill is an open dump, essen-\ntially a field or large pit where garbage is deposited and sometimes burned. Open dumps are rare in more-developed countries, but are widely used near major cities in many less-developed countries. China disposes of much of its rapidly growing mountains of solid waste mostly in rural open dumps or in poorly designed and poorly regu-lated landfills that do not have most of the features of sani-tary landfills.\n90446_ch16_428-451.indd   441 8/13/14   11:17 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Denmark follows these priori-ties, but most countries do not.\nAs with solid waste, the top priority should be pollu-\ntion prevention and waste reduction. With this approach, industries try to find substitutes for toxic or hazardous materials, reuse or recycle the hazardous materials within industrial processes, or use or sell them as raw materials for making other products. (See the online Guest Essays on this subject by Lois Gibbs and Peter Montague.)\nAt least 33% of industrial hazardous wastes produced \nin the European Union are exchanged through clearing-houses where they are sold as raw materials for use by other industries. The producers of these wastes do not have to pay for their disposal and recipients get low-cost raw materials. About 10% of the hazardous waste in the United States is exchanged through such clearinghouses, a figure that could be raised significantly.\nWe can also recycle e-waste (Core Case Study). How-\never, most e-waste recycling can create health hazards, especially for workers in some less-developed countries (see the following Case Study).\nCASE STUDY\nRecycling E-Waste\nIn some countries, workers in e-waste recycling opera-tions\u2014many of them children\u2014are often exposed to toxic chemicals as they dismantle the electronic trash to extract its valuable metals or other parts that can be sold for reuse or recycling (Core Case Study).\nAccording to the United Nations, more than 70% of \nthe world\u2019s e-waste is shipped to China. A center for such waste is the small port city of Guiyu, where the air reeks of burning plastic and acid fumes. There, more than 5,500 small-scale e-waste businesses employ over 30,000 people (including some children). They work for very low wages in dangerous conditions to extract valuable metals like gold, silver, copper, and various rare earth metals (see \nFIGURE 16.16   Integrated hazardous waste management: The U.S. National Academy of Sciences \nhas suggested these priorities for dealing with hazardous waste (Concept 16.5).

They carry out dan-gerous activities such as smashing TV picture tubes with large hammers to recover certain components\u2014a method that releases large amounts of toxic lead dust into the air. They also burn computer wires to expose copper, melt circuit boards in metal pots over coal fires to extract lead and other metals, and douse the boards with strong acid to extract gold. After the valuable metals are removed, left-over parts are burned or dumped into rivers or onto the land. An estimated 82% of the Guiyu area\u2019s children younger than age 6 suffer from lead poisoning.\nThe United States produces roughly 50% of the world\u2019s \ne-waste and recycles only about 14% of it, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. However, by 2013, at least 20 states had banned the disposal of computers and TV sets in landfills and incinerators, and these measures set the stage for an emerging, highly profitable e-cycling industry. In 2013, 13 states along with New York City made manufac-turers responsible for recycling most electronic devices.\nSome have called for a U.S. federal law that would \nmake manufacturers responsible for taking back all elec-tronic devices they produce and recycling them domesti-cally. It could be similar to laws in the European Union, where a recycling fee typically covers the costs of such programs. Without such a law there is little incentive for recycling e-waste and plastics. Mike Biddle (Individuals Matter 16.1, p. 437) chose to open his plastics recycling plants in China, England, and Austria, where markets for his product are stronger, instead of in the United States.\nRecycling probably will not keep up with the explosive \ngrowth of e-waste, and there is money to be made from illegally sending such materials to other countries. The only real long-term solution is a prevention approach through which electrical and electronic products would be designed to be produced and easily repaired, remanufac-tured, or recycled, without the use of toxic materials.\nWe Can Detoxify Hazardous Wastes\nThe first step in dealing with hazardous wastes is to collect them. In Denmark, all hazardous and toxic wastes from industries and households are delivered to any of 21 trans-fer stations throughout the country. From there they are taken to a large processing facility, where three-fourths of the waste is detoxified by physical, chemical, and biologi-cal methods. The rest is buried in a carefully designed and monitored landfill.\nPhysical methods for detoxifying hazardous wastes in-\nclude using charcoal or resins to filter out harmful solids, distilling liquid wastes to separate out harmful chemicals, and precipitating such chemicals from solution. Especially deadly wastes can be encapsulated in glass, cement, or ceramics and then put in secure storage sites. Chemical methods are used to convert hazardous chemicals to harm-less or less harmful chemicals through chemical reactions.\nSome scientists and engineers consider biological meth-\nods for treatment of hazardous waste to be the wave of the future. One such approach is bioremediation, in which bac-teria and enzymes help to destroy toxic or hazardous sub-stances or convert them to harmless compounds. Bioremediation takes a little longer to work than most physical and chemical methods, but it costs much less. (See the online Guest Essay by John Pichtel on this topic.)\nAnother approach is phytoremediation, which involves \nusing natural or genetically engineered plants to absorb, filter, and remove contaminants from polluted soil and water.

Various plants have been identified as \u201cpollution sponges\u201d that can be used to help clean up soil and water contaminated with chemicals such as pesticides, organic solvents, and radioactive or toxic metals. Phytoremedia-tion is still being evaluated and is slow, compared to other alternatives.\nIncineration of hazardous wastes has the same combi-\nnation of advantages and disadvantages as does the burn-ing of solid wastes (Figure 16.13). However, incinerating hazardous waste without effective and expensive air pol-lution controls can release air pollutants such as highly toxic dioxins, and it produces an extremely toxic ash that must be safely and permanently stored in a landfill or vault especially designed for this hazardous end product.\nWe can also detoxify hazardous wastes by using plasma \ngasification, a technology that uses arcs of electrical energy to produce very high temperatures in order to vaporize trash in the absence of oxygen. This process reduces the volume of a given amount of waste by 99%, produces a synthetic gaseous fuel, and encapsulates toxic metals and other materials in glassy lumps of rock. So why are we not making widespread use of the plasma arc torch to detoxify hazardous wastes? The main reason is its high cost. Plasma arc companies are working to bring the cost down.\nWe Can Store Some Forms  \nof Hazardous Waste\nIdeally, we should use burial on land or long-term storage \nof hazardous and toxic wastes in secure vaults only as the third and last resort after the first two priorities have been exhausted (Figure 16.16 and Concept 16.5). Currently, however, burial on land is the most widely used method in the United States and in most countries, largely because of its lower cost.\nThe most common form of burial is deep-well disposal, in \nwhich liquid hazardous wastes are pumped under high pressure through a pipe into dry, porous rock formations far beneath aquifers that are tapped for drinking and irri-gation water (see Figure 11.26, p. 272). Theoretically, these liquids soak into the porous rock material and are isolated from overlying groundwater by essentially imper -\n90446_ch16_428-451.indd   443 8/13/14   11:17 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The cost is low and the \nwastes can often be retrieved if problems develop. How-ever, there are a limited number of such sites and limited space within them. Sometimes the wastes can leak into groundwater from the well shaft or migrate into ground-water in unexpected ways. Also, this is an output approach that encourages the production of hazardous wastes.\nIn the United States, almost two-thirds of all liquid \nhazardous wastes are injected into deep disposal wells. And this amount will increase sharply as the country relies more on fracking to produce natural gas and oil trapped in shale rock (see Science Focus 13.1, p. 318). Many scien-tists argue that current regulations for deep-well disposal in the United States are inadequate and should be im-proved (see the Case Study that follows). Figure 16.17 lists the advantages and disadvantages of using deep-well dis-posal of liquid hazardous wastes.\nSome liquid hazardous wastes are stored in lined \nponds, pits, or lagoons, called surface impoundments. Some-\ntimes they include liners that help to contain the waste. As the water evaporates, the waste settles and becomes more concentrated. However, where liners are not used and wherever the liners leak, such wastes can percolate into groundwater. Also, because these impoundments are not covered, volatile harmful chemicals can evaporate, pollut-ing the air. In addition, powerful storms can cause such ponds to overflow. Figure 16.18 lists the advantages and disadvantages of using this method.\nEPA studies have found that 70% of all U.S. hazardous \nwaste storage ponds have no liners and could threaten groundwater supplies. According to the EPA, eventually, all impoundment liners are likely to leak and could con-taminate groundwater.\nSometimes both liquid and solid hazardous wastes are \nput into drums or other containers and buried in carefully designed and monitored secure hazardous waste landfills (Figure 16.19). This is the least-used method because of the expense involved.\nFigure 16.20 lists some ways in which you can reduce \nyour output of hazardous waste\u2014the first step in dealing with it.FIGURE 16.17   Injecting liquid hazardous wastes into deep under -\nground wells has advantages and disadvantages.

Under this act, the EPA sets standards for the management of several types of hazardous waste and issues permits to companies that allow them to produce and dispose of a certain amount of those wastes by approved methods. Permit holders must use a cradle-to-grave system to keep track of waste they transfer from a point of generation (cradle) to an approved off-site disposal facility (grave), and they must submit proof of this disposal to the EPA.\nRCRA is a good start, but about 95% of the hazardous \nand toxic wastes, including e-waste, produced in the United States is not regulated. In most other countries, especially less-developed countries, the amount of regu-lated waste is even smaller.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Hazardous Waste\nWhy is it that 95% of the hazardous waste, including the growing amounts of \ne-waste (Core Case Study) produced in the United States, is not regulated? Do you favor regulating such wastes? What do you think would be the eco-nomic consequences of doing so?\nIn 1976, the U.S. Congress passed the Toxic Substances \nControl Act, which was intended to regulate and ensure \nthe safety of the thousands of chemicals used in the manu-facture of many products and contained in many products. Under this law, companies must notify the EPA before in-troducing a new chemical into the marketplace, but they are not required to provide any data about its safety. In other words, any new chemical is viewed as safe unless the EPA can show that it is harmful.\nSince 1976, the EPA, with a very limited budget, has \nused this act to ban only 5 of the roughly 80,000 chemicals in use. Environmental and health scientists call for Con-gress to reform this almost 40-year-old law by requiring manufacturers to provide data showing that a chemical or product containing a certain chemical is safe before it can be sold in the marketplace.\nIn 1980, the U.S. Congress passed the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, com-monly known as the CERCLA or Superfund program, super -\nvised by the EPA. Its goals are to identify sites, commonly called Superfund sites, where hazardous wastes have con-taminated the environment and to clean them up, using EPA-approved methods, on a priority basis. The worst sites\u2014those that represent an immediate and severe threat to human health\u2014are put on a National Priorities List and scheduled for cleanup.\nBy May 2014, there were 1,326 sites on the Super -\nfund list, along with 51 proposed new sites, and 375 sites had been cleaned up and removed from the list. The Waste Management Research Institute estimates that at least 10,000 sites should be on the priority list and that cleanup of these sites would cost about $1.7 trillion, not including legal fees. This is a glaring example of the eco-nomic and environmental value of emphasizing waste reduction and pollution prevention over the end-of-pipe  \ncleanup approach that the United States and most coun-tries rely on.\nIn 1984, Congress amended the Superfund Act to \ngive citizens the right to know what toxic chemicals are being stored or released in their communities. This re-quired 23,800 large manufacturing facilities to report their annual releases of any of nearly 650 toxic chemi-cals. If you live in the United States, you can find out what toxic chemicals are being stored and released in your neighborhood by going to the EPA\u2019s Toxic Release Inventory website.\nThe Superfund Act, designed to make polluters pay for \ncleaning up abandoned hazardous waste sites, greatly re-duced the number of illegal dumpsites around the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3876, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81df04b9-8810-4cd1-b8b3-c54e09c3cafd": {"__data__": {"id_": "81df04b9-8810-4cd1-b8b3-c54e09c3cafd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "445", "file_name": "G.

It also forced waste producers who were fearful of liability claims to reduce their production of such waste and to recycle or reuse much more of it. However, under pressure from polluters, the U.S. Congress refused to re-new the tax on oil and chemical companies that had fi-nanced the Superfund legislation after it expired in 1995. The Superfund is now broke, and taxpayers, not polluters, are footing the bill for cleanups when the responsible par -\nties cannot be found. As a result, the pace of cleanup has slowed.

Health risks from incinerators and landfills, when averaged over the entire country, are quite low, but the risks for people living near such facilities are much higher.\nManufacturers and waste industry officials point out \nthat something must be done with the toxic and hazard-ous wastes created in the production of certain goods and services. They contend that even if local citizens adopt a \u201cnot in my back yard\u201d (NIMBY) approach, the waste will always end up in someone\u2019s back yard.\nMany citizens do not accept this argument. To them, \nthe best way to deal with most toxic and hazardous waste is to produce much less of it, as suggested by the U.S. Na-tional Academy of Sciences (Figure 16.16). For such mate-rials, they argue that the goal should be \u201cnot in anyone\u2019s back yard\u201d (NIABY) or \u201cnot on planet Earth\u201d (NOPE), which calls for drastically reducing production of such wastes by emphasizing pollution and waste prevention.\nWe Can Encourage Reuse and Recycling\nThree factors hinder reuse and recycling. First, the market prices of almost all products do not include the harmful environmental and health costs associated with producing, using, and discarding them\u2014a violation of the full-cost pricing principle of sustainability.\nSecond, the economic playing field is uneven, because \nin most countries, resource extraction industries receive more government tax breaks and subsidies than reuse and recycling industries get.\nThird, the demand and thus the price paid for recycled \nmaterials fluctuates, mostly because it is not a high priority for most governments, businesses, and individuals to buy goods made of recycled materials.\nHow can we encourage reuse and recycling? Proponents \nsay that leveling the economic playing field is the best way to start. Governments can increase subsidies and tax breaks for reusing and recycling materials, and decrease subsidies and tax breaks for making items from virgin resources.\nAnother strategy is to greatly increase use of the fee-per-\nbag waste collection system that charges households for the trash they throw away but not for their recyclable and reus-able wastes. When the U.S. city of Fort Worth, Texas, insti-tuted such a program, the proportion of households recycling their trash went from 21% to 85%. The city went from losing $600,000 in its recycling program to making $1 million a year because of increased sales of recycled materials to industries.\nGovernments can also pass laws requiring companies \nto take back and recycle or reuse packaging and electronic waste discarded by consumers (Core Case Study), as is done in Japan and some European Union countries. Another important strategy is to encourage or require government purchases of recycled products to help increase demand for and lower prices of these products. Also, citizens can pressure governments to require product labeling that lists the recycled content of products, as well as the types and amounts of any hazardous materials they contain.\nReuse, Recycling, and Composting Present \nEconomic Opportunities\nA growing number of people are saving money through \nreuse, regularly going to yard sales,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3822, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e303807b-36e8-46cd-b3e3-f01ed5a37ec4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e303807b-36e8-46cd-b3e3-f01ed5a37ec4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "446", "file_name": "G.

Another such site, the Freecycle Network, links people who want to give away their unused household belong-ings to people who want or need them.\nFor many, recycling has become a business opportu-\nnity. In particular, upcycling, or recycling materials into products of a higher value, is a growing field. For example, a British company called Worn Again is converting dis-carded textiles, such as old hot-air balloons and worn-out seat covers, into windbreaker jackets and other products. And researcher Na Lu at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, has found a way to upcycle plastic bottles to make a building material that could outperform composite lumber and wood lumber. Entrepreneurs see upcycling as an area of great economic opportunity, and it represents a golden opportunity for those interested in creating or ex-panding their positive environmental impact.\nInternational Treaties Have Reduced \nHazardous Waste\nFor decades, some countries regularly shipped hazardous \nwastes to other countries for disposal or processing. How-ever, since 1992, an international treaty known as the Basel Convention has banned participating countries from shipping hazardous waste (including e-waste; see Core Case Study) to or through other countries without their permission. By 2013, this agreement had been ratified (formally approved and implemented) by 179 countries.

In 1995, the treaty was amended to outlaw all \ntransfers of hazardous wastes from industrial countries to less-developed countries. This ban is likely to be ratified by enough countries to go into effect in the next few years.\nThis ban will help, but it will not wipe out the very \nprofitable illegal shipping of hazardous wastes. Hazardous waste smugglers evade the laws by using an array of tac-tics, including bribes, false permits, and mislabeling of hazardous wastes as recyclable materials.\nIn 2000, delegates from 122 countries completed a \nglobal treaty known as the Stockholm Convention on Per -\nsistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). It regulates the use of 12 widely used persistent organic pollutants that can accumu-late in the fatty tissues of humans and other animals that occupy high trophic levels in food webs. At such levels, these hazardous chemicals can reach levels hundreds of thousands of times higher than their levels in the general environment (see Figure 8.9, p. 171). Because they persist in the environment, POPs can also be transported long distances by wind and water.\nThe original list of 12 hazardous chemicals, called the \ndirty dozen, includes DDT and eight other chlorine-containing persistent pesticides, PCBs, dioxins, and furans. Using blood tests and statistical sampling, medical re-searchers at New York City\u2019s Mount Sinai School of Medi-cine found that it is likely that nearly every person on earth has detectable levels of POPs in their bodies. The long-term health effects of this involuntary global chemi-cal experiment are largely unknown.\nBy 2014, 179 countries had ratified a strengthened ver -\nsion of the POPs treaty that seeks to ban or phase out the use of these hazardous chemicals and to detoxify or isolate existing stockpiles. It allows 25 countries to continue using DDT to combat malaria until safer alternatives are found. As of 2014, the United States had not yet ratified this treaty. The list of regulated POPs is expected to grow.\nIn 2000, the Swedish Parliament enacted a law that, by \n2020, will ban all potentially hazardous chemicals that are persistent in the environment and can accumulate in living tissue. This law also requires industries to perform risk assess-ments on the chemicals they use and to show that these chemicals are safe to use, as opposed to requiring the govern-ment to show that they are dangerous. In other words, chemicals are assumed to be guilty until proven innocent\u2014the reverse of the current policy in the United States and most other countries. There is strong opposition to this approach in the United States, especially from most of the industries that produce and use potentially hazardous chemicals.\nWe Can Make the Transition to  \nLow-Waste Economies\nAccording to physicist Albert Einstein, \u201cA clever person \nsolves a problem; a wise person avoids it.\u201d Many people are taking these words seriously. The governments of Nor -\nway, Austria, and the Netherlands have committed to re-ducing their resource waste by 75%. Many school cafeterias, restaurants, national parks, and corporations are participating in a rapidly growing \u201czero waste\u201d move-ment to reduce, reuse, and recycle, and some have low-ered their waste outputs by up to 80%, with the ultimate goal of eliminating their waste outputs. They are applying nature\u2019s chemical cycling principle of sustainabil-ity (see the following Case Study}.\nCASE STUDY\nIndustrial Ecosystems: Copying Nature\nAn important goal for a more sustainable society is to make its industrial manufacturing processes cleaner and more sus-tainable by redesigning them to mimic the way nature deals with wastes\u2014an approach called biomimicry.

This explains why there is essentially no waste in undisturbed ecosystems.\nOne way for industries to mimic nature is to reuse or \nrecycle most of the minerals and chemicals they use, in-stead of burying or burning them or shipping them some-where. Another method that industries can use to mimic nature is to interact with each other through resource ex-change webs in which the wastes of one manufacturer be-come the raw materials for another\u2014similar to food webs in natural ecosystems (see Figure 3.10, p. 49).\nThis is happening in Kalundborg, Denmark, where an \nelectric power plant and nearby industries, farms, and homes are collaborating to save money and to reduce their outputs of waste and pollution within what is called an ecoindustrial park, or industrial ecosystem. They exchange waste outputs and convert them into resources, as shown in Figure 16.21. This cuts pollution and waste and reduces the flow of nonrenewable mineral and energy resources through the local economy.\nToday, more than 40 ecoindustrial parks (18 of them in \nthe United States) operate in various places around the world, and more are being built or planned. A number of people who work in the rapidly growing field of industrial ecology are focusing on developing a global network of industrial ecosystems over the next few decades, and this could lead to an important ecoindustrial revolution. \nGREEN \nCAREER:  Industrial ecology\nEcoindustrial parks provide many economic benefits for \nbusinesses. By encouraging recycling and waste reduction prevention, they reduce the costs of managing solid wastes, controlling pollution, and complying with pollution regula-tions. They also reduce a company\u2019s chances of being sued because of damages, to people or to the environment, caused by their actions. In addition, companies improve the health and safety of workers by reducing their expo-sure to toxic and hazardous materials, thereby reducing \n90446_ch16_428-451.indd   447 8/13/14   11:17 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Biomimicry also encour -\nages companies to come up with new, environmentally \nbeneficial, and less resource-intensive chemicals, processes, and products that they can sell worldwide.\nBiomimicry involves two major steps. The first is to \nstudy how natural systems have responded to changes in environmental conditions over many millions of years. The second step is to try to copy or adapt these responses within human systems in order to help us deal with vari-ous environmental challenges. In the case of solid and hazardous wastes, the food web serves as a natural model for responding to the growing problem of these wastes. This is in keeping with the three scientific princi-ples of sustainability that nature has used for bil-lions of years.FIGURE 16.21   Solutions: This industrial ecosystem in Kalundborg, Denmark, reduces waste production by mimicking a natural ecosystem\u2019s food \nweb.

In doing so, we would benefit the environment, cre-ate new jobs and businesses capitalizing on the four \nrs, and \ngain health and environmental benefits for us, thus finding win-win \n solutions. This could also lead \nto lower levels of resource use per person, and thus a lower demand for materials that eventually become solid and hazardous wastes. All these measures together would help us  \nto pass along to future generations a world that is at least as livable or more so than the one we have enjoyed.One of the problems  of maintaining a \nhigh-waste society is the growing mass of e-waste (Core Case Study) and other types of solid and hazardous waste dis-cussed in this chapter. The challenge is to make the transition from an unsustainable high-waste, throwaway economy to a more sustainable low-waste, reducing\u2013reusing\u2013recycling econ-omy as soon as possible.\nSuch a transition will require applying the six princi-  \nples of sustainability.  We can reduce our outputs of  \nsolid and hazardous waste by relying much less on fossil fuels and nuclear power (which produces long-lived, hazardous ra-dioactive wastes) while relying much more on renewable en-ergy from the sun, wind, and flowing water. We can mimic nature\u2019s chemical cycling processes by reusing and recycling materials as much as possible. Integrated waste management, which uses a diversity of approaches and emphasizes waste reduction and pollution prevention, is a way to mimic nature\u2019s use of biodiversity.\nBy including more of the harmful environmental and \nhealth costs of the consumer economy in market prices,  \nBakalusha/Shutterstock.com\n90446_ch16_428-451.indd   449 8/13/14   11:17", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3666, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91169c37-e55c-4a6d-b281-784cc5c55fa6": {"__data__": {"id_": "91169c37-e55c-4a6d-b281-784cc5c55fa6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "449", "file_name": "G.

Meeting this challenge depends largely on the decisions and actions of the United States and China\u2014the two countries that lead the world in resource consumption and production of wastes and pollutants.\nFrom 1940 to 1970, the United \nStates experienced rapid economic growth along with severe pollution and degradation of air, water, and land. By 1970, public awareness of these problems had grown and spurred an environmental movement made up of millions of citizens who demanded an end to this environmen-tal degradation. This prompted the U.S. Congress to pass a number of environmental laws that have led to improvements in the nation\u2019s environmental quality.\nDespite this impor -\ntant progress, the United States, with the third largest population, has the world\u2019s largest ecological footprint (Figure 17.1, left), mostly because it uses far more resources per person than any other country. That means it also has the world\u2019s largest per capita ecological footprint (Figure 17.1, left). If everyone in the world used resources equal to what the average American uses, we would need about five planet Earths to support them (Figure 17.1, right), according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Global Footprint Network. And the U.S. population growth rate is the highest of any industrialized country.\nChina has the world\u2019s largest pop-\nulation and the second largest econ-omy. China\u2019s economy grew rapidly for three decades, beginning in the late 1970s, after the country shifted partially from a centrally planned economy to more of a market-based economy. As in the U.S. case, China\u2019s economic growth has resulted in severe environmental problems, which have contributed to its total ecologi-cal footprint\u2014the second largest in \nthe world (Figure 17.1, \nleft). Also, China\u2019s con-sumer middle class, living mostly in its large cities, has grown to roughly 300 million\u2014a number almost equal to the U.S. population. Still, the large majority of Chinese citi-zens are poor and as a result, the per capita ecological footprint in China is about one-sixth that of the United States (Figure 17.1, left).\nSince the 1960s, China has cut its \nbirth rate in half and its population is now growing at a rate slower than that of the United States. However, if its middle class continues to grow and consume more resources as projected, China could have the world\u2019s largest per capita and total ecological foot-prints within a decade or two.\nThis chapter is about the eco-\nnomic, political, and ethical aspects of environmental problems and solu-tions. As you will see, all three aspects are illustrated in a comparison of eco-nomic growth in the United States and China, along with consideration of the future of such growth and what it will mean to global sustainability.\n90446_ch17_452-484.indd   454 8/13/14   11:21 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In a market-based economic system, buyers and sellers interact competitively to make economic decisions about how goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed. In a truly free-market economic system, all economic decisions are gov-erned solely by the competitive interactions of supply (the amount of a good or service that is available), demand (the amount of a good or service that people want), and price (the market value of a good or service). If the demand for a good or service is greater than the supply, its price rises, and when supply exceeds demand, the price falls.\nAlso, in a truly free-market economic system, (1) no \ncompany or small group of companies could control the prices of any goods or services; (2) the market prices of \ngoods and services would include all of their direct and in-direct costs (full-cost pricing); and (3) consumers would have full information about the beneficial and harmful environ-mental and health effects of the goods and services avail-able to them. The economies of the world\u2019s countries are not truly free-market economies, because the combined actions of their governments and many of their corpora-tions result in major violations of these three principles.\nMost economic systems use three types of capital, or \nresources, to produce goods and services (Figure 17.2). Natural capital (see Figure 1.3, p. 7) includes resources and ecosystem services produced by the earth\u2019s natural processes, which support all life and all economies.\n  Human capital includes the physical and mental talents of the people who provide labor, organizational and man-agement skills, and innovation. Manufactured capital includes the machinery, materials, and factories that peo-ple create using natural resources.\nThere Is Controversy over the \nSustainability of Economic Growth\nEconomic growth is an increase in the capacity of a na-\ntion, state, city, or company to provide goods and services to people. Today, a typical industrialized country depends on a high-throughput economy, which attempts to boost economic growth by increasing the flow of natural matter and energy resources through the economic system to produce more goods and services (Figure 17.3). Such an economy produces valuable goods and services, but it also converts large quantities of high-quality matter and en-ergy resources into waste, pollution, and low-quality heat, which tend to flow into planetary sinks (air, water, soil, and organisms).\nEconomic development is any set of efforts focused \non creating economies that can serve to improve human well-being by meeting basic human needs for items such as food, shelter, physical and economic security, and good health. The world\u2019s countries vary greatly in their levels of \nFIGURE 17.2   We use three types of resources to produce goods and services.\nCenter: Elena Elisseeva/Shutterstock.com.

(See Figure 17.1 and \nFigure 3, p. S18, in Supplement 4 to compare the world\u2019s countries in terms of per capita income.)\nFor more than 200 years, there has been a debate over \nwhether there are limits to economic growth. Neoclassical economists, such as the late Alfred Marshall (1842\u20131924) and the late Milton Friedman (1912\u20132006), assume that the potential for economic growth is essentially unlimited and is necessary for providing profits for businesses and jobs for workers. They also consider natural capital to be important but not indispensable because they believe we can find substitutes for essentially any resource that we might deplete or degrade.\nEcological economists such as Herman Daly (see his on-\nline Guest Essay on this topic) and Robert Costanza dis-agree with the neoclassical model. They point out that there are no substitutes for many vital natural resources, such as clean air, clean water, fertile soil, and biodiversity, or for crucial ecosystem services such as climate control, air and water purification, pest control, pollination, topsoil renewal, and nutrient cycling. In contrast to neoclassical economists, they view human economic systems as sub-systems of the biosphere that depend heavily on the earth\u2019s irreplaceable natural resources and ecosystem ser -\nvices (Figure 17.4).\nClosely related to the school of ecological economics is \nthat of environmental economics. Economists in this school favor adjusting existing economic policies and tools to be more environmentally beneficial over inventing all-new policies and tools.\nNow the debate among these economists is shifting to \nquestions about what kinds of economic growth and de-velopment we should encourage. Economic growth does not necessarily mean more pollution and environmental degradation. It depends on the kinds of economic growth, the technologies involved, and whether nations pass and enforce laws that regulate inputs of harmful chemicals into the environment (see Table 1.1, p. 13).\nEcological and environmental economists call for rec-\nognizing the relationship between our economic systems and the earth\u2019s natural capital shown in Figure 17.4, and they contend that, without regulation of harmful inputs into the environment, conventional economic growth eventually will become unsustainable. Therefore, they ar -\ngue, we should promote environmentally sustainable economic development, an approach that uses political \nANIMATED FIGURE 17.4   Ecological economists see all human economies as subsystems of the \nbiosphere that depend on natural resources and services provided by the sun and earth.

Such costs are of-ten called hidden costs.\nFor example, if we buy a car, the price we pay includes \nthe direct, or internal, costs of raw materials, labor, shipping, \nand a markup for dealer profit. In using the car, we pay additional direct costs for gasoline, maintenance, repairs, and insurance. However, in order to extract and process raw materials to make a car, manufacturers use energy and mineral resources, produce solid and hazardous wastes, disturb land, pollute the air and water, and release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These are the hid-den external costs that can have short- or long-term harm-ful effects on us, on future generations, on our economies, and on the earth\u2019s life-support systems.\nBecause these harmful external costs are not included \nin the market price of a car, most people do not connect them with car ownership. Still, the car buyer and other people in a society pay these hidden costs sooner or later, in the forms of poorer health, higher expenses for health care and insurance, higher taxes for pollution control, and degradation of natural capital.\nMany economists and environmental experts call for \nincluding these harmful external costs in the market prices of goods\u2014a practice called full-cost pricing, and the basis for one of the social science principles of sustain-ability. They cite this failure to include the harmful environmental costs in the market prices of goods and services as one of the major causes of the environmental problems we face (see Figure 1.11, p. 14).\nAccording to its proponents, full-cost pricing would \nreduce resource waste, pollution, and environmental deg-radation and improve human health by encouraging pro-ducers to invent more resource-efficient and less-polluting methods of production. It would also enable consumers to make more informed decisions about the goods and ser -\nvices they buy. For example, if the harmful environmental and health costs of mining and burning coal to produce electricity (Figure 17.5) were included in the market prices of coal and coal-fired electricity, coal would be much more expensive and likely would be replaced by less environ-mentally harmful resources such as natural gas and solar and wind power.\nImplementation of full-cost pricing would result in \nsome industries and businesses disappearing or remaking themselves, while new ones would appear\u2014a normal and revitalizing process in a dynamic and creative capitalist economy. If we were to phase in a shift to full-cost pricing over a decade or two, some environmentally harmful busi-nesses would have time to transform themselves into prof-itable, environmentally beneficial businesses.\nFull-cost pricing seems to make a lot of sense. Why, \nthen, is it not used more widely? First, most producers of harmful products and services would have to charge more for them, and some would go out of business. Naturally, these producers oppose such pricing. Second, it is difficult to estimate many environmental and health costs, and to know how they might change in the future. Third, many environmentally harmful businesses have used their", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4005, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0c48eb2-205c-4078-be3d-6352b279e273": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0c48eb2-205c-4078-be3d-6352b279e273", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "457", "file_name": "G.

Third, many environmentally harmful businesses have used their po-litical and economic power to obtain government subsi-dies, or payments and protections of various forms that help them to stay in business, and this helps them to avoid true free-market competition and to retain their economic advantage.\nWe Can Shift from Environmentally \nHarmful to Environmentally  Beneficial Subsidies\nGovernments can use subsidies to encourage producers to \nwork toward full-cost pricing. However, some subsidies enable businesses to operate in such a way that they do damage to the environment or to human health. Accord-ing to environmental scientist Norman Myers, such per-verse subsidies cost the world\u2019s governments (taxpayers) at least $2 trillion a year\u2014an average $3.8 million a minute! Myers also estimates that perverse subsidies cost the aver -\nage American taxpayer $2,000 per year. (See Myers\u2019 on-line Guest Essay on this topic.)\nPerverse subsidies can distort the economic playing \nfield and create a huge economic incentive for resource depletion and environmental degradation.

In other words, over the next few decades we could make a subsidy shift from environmentally harmful to environmentally beneficial subsidies, thereby increasing our beneficial environmental impact.\nMaking such a shift would not be easy because the \npowerful interests that receive perverse subsidies spend a lot of time and money lobbying, or trying to influence gov-ernments to continue their subsidies. They also work to deny subsidies to their more environmentally beneficial competitors. But countries including Japan, France, and Belgium have made such shifts.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Subsidies\nDo you favor phasing out environmentally harmful government subsidies and \ntax breaks, and phasing in environmentally beneficial ones?

How might such sub-sidy shifting affect your lifestyle?Environmental Indicators Can Help Us Live \nMore Sustainably\nEconomic growth is usually measured by the percentage \nof change per year in a country\u2019s gross domestic prod-uct (GDP): the annual market value of all goods and services produced by all firms and organizations, foreign and domestic, operating within a country. A country\u2019s eco-nomic growth per person is measured by changes in the per capita GDP: the GDP divided by the country\u2019s total population at midyear.\nGDP and per capita GDP indicators provide a standard-\nized, useful method for measuring and comparing the eco-nomic outputs of nations. However, the GDP was deliberately designed to measure such outputs without taking into ac-count their beneficial or harmful environmental impacts. Environmental and ecological economists and environmen-tal scientists call for the development and widespread use of new indicators\u2014called environmental indicators\u2014to help monitor environmental quality and human well-being.\nOne such indicator is the genuine progress indica-\ntor (GPI)\u2014the GDP plus the estimated value of beneficial transactions that meet basic needs, minus the estimated \nAndreas Reinhold/Shutterstock\nFIGURE 17.5   Most of the harmful environmental effects of strip-mining coal and burning it to pro-\nduce electricity are not included in the cost of electricity.The price of coal does not include \nthe harmful environmental costs of producing and burning it.\n90446_ch17_452-484.indd   458 8/13/14   11:21 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Examples of beneficial transactions included in the GPI are unpaid volunteer work, health care pro-vided by family members, child care, and housework. Harmful costs that are subtracted to arrive at the GPI in-clude the costs of pollution, resource depletion and degra-dation, and crime. The GPI was developed by environmental economists with the hope that governments would adopt it. However, it has not yet been implemented by any of the world\u2019s economies.\nAnother set of environmental indicators, developed by \nthe United Nations, compares the world\u2019s countries in terms of environmental quality. It uses various measures, including CO\n2 emissions, marine and terrestrial protected \nareas, forest cover, water supplies, and municipal waste collection. Figure 17.6 shows one example of the sort of data used for these indicators.\nResearchers led by Kelly Cain at the St. Croix Institute \nfor Sustainable Community Development have developed a computer model that makes use of sustainable commu-nity development indicators. For example, the model esti-mates the amount of money and other resources that leave any community that imports most of its food, usu-ally through large grocery stores. Cain argues that such a community can save large amounts of money and shrink its ecological footprint by learning how to produce much more of its own food and energy.\nThese and other environmental indicators now being \ndeveloped are far from perfect. However, without such indicators, it will be impossible to monitor the overall ef-fects of human activities on human health, on the environ-ment, and on the planet\u2019s natural capital. Such indicators are also helpful for finding the best ways to improve envi-ronmental quality and life satisfaction.\nWe Can Tax Pollution and Wastes Instead \nof Wages and Profits\nAnother way to discourage pollution and resource waste is \nto tax it (Concept 17.2). Green taxes could be levied on a \nper-unit basis on the amount of pollution and hazardous waste produced by a farm, business, or industry, and on the use of fossil fuels, nitrogen fertilizer, timber, minerals, water, and other resources. This approach would help us to implement the full-cost pricing principle of sus-tainability and increase our beneficial environmen-tal impact.\nTo many analysts, the tax systems in most countries \nare backward. They discourage what we want more of\u2014jobs, income, and profit-driven innovation\u2014and encourage what we want less of\u2014pollution, resource waste, and en-vironmental degradation. A more environmentally sus-tainable economic and political system would lower taxes on labor, income, and wealth, and raise taxes on environ-mental activities that produce pollution, wastes, and envi-ronmental degradation. Some 2,500 economists, including eight Nobel Prize winners in economics, have endorsed this tax-shifting concept.\nProponents point out three requirements for the suc-\ncessful implementation of green taxes. First, they would have to be phased in over 10\u201320 years to allow businesses to plan for the future. Second, income, payroll, or other taxes would have to be reduced by an amount equal to that of the green tax so that there would be no net in-crease in taxes. Third, the poor and lower-middle class would need a safety net to reduce the regressive nature of any new taxes on essentials such as fuel, water, electricity, and food. Figure 17.7 lists some of the advantages and disadvantages of using green taxes.\nIn Europe and the United States, polls indicate that \nonce such tax shifting is explained to voters, 70% of them support the idea.

The goal of this global program, sponsored by a number of organizations including the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP), is to encourage and assist governments in devoting more of their spending to purchases of goods and services that are sustainably produced and provided.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations Can \nDiscourage or Encourage Innovation\nEnvironmental regulation is a form of government interven-\ntion in the marketplace that is widely used to help control or prevent pollution and environmental degradation and to encourage more efficient use of resources. It involves enacting and enforcing laws that set pollution standards, regulate the release of toxic chemicals into the environ-ment, and protect certain slowly replenished resources such as public forests, parks, and wilderness areas from unsustainable use.\nSuch regulation is another way to help implement the \nfull-cost pricing principle of sustainability, because it forces companies to include more of the costs of pollution control and other regulated aspects in the prices of their products. For this reason, opponents of regulation claim that it hurts business, especially in markets where they are competing with China and other countries whose regulations are not as strong as those of the United States (Core Case Study).\nHowever, proponents of regulation point to the results \nof China\u2019s lax environmental regulations. While that coun-try\u2019s economy has been growing rapidly since 1980, its environmental problems have also multiplied dramati-cally. Now, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, its major cities suffer from serious air pollution; about 57% of its urban groundwater, used for drinking water for hun-dreds of millions of people, and 43% of its surface water is too polluted to use; its topsoil is severely polluted; and some of its food is tainted with harmful chemicals. These problems are leading to civil unrest in China as well as to a less favorable standing in the global marketplace.\nSo far, most environmental regulation in the United \nStates and in many other countries has involved passing laws that are typically enforced through a command-and-control approach. Critics say that this strategy can unneces-sarily increase costs and discourage innovation, because many of these government regulations concentrate on cleanup instead of prevention. Some regulations also set compliance deadlines that are often too short to allow com-panies to find innovative solutions to pollution and waste.\nA different approach favored by many economists, as \nwell as environmental and business leaders, is to use incentive-based environmental regulations. Rather than to re-quire all companies in a particular market to follow the same fixed procedures or use the same technologies, this approach uses the economic forces of the marketplace to encourage businesses to be innovative in reducing pollu-tion and resource waste.\nSeveral European nations use such innovation-friendly \nenvironmental regulation, which involves setting goals, es-tablishing heavy penalties for not meeting the goals, free-ing industries to meet the goals in any way that works, and allowing enough time for innovation. This has moti-vated several companies to develop green products and industrial processes that have created jobs. It has also helped some companies to boost their profits while becoming more competitive in national and interna-tional markets.\nWe Can Use the Marketplace to Reduce \nPollution and Resource Waste\nIn one incentive-based regulation system, the government \ndecides on acceptable levels of total pollution or resource use, sets limits, or caps, to maintain these levels, and gives or sells companies a certain number of tradable pollution or resource-use permits governed by the caps.\nWith this cap-and-trade approach, a permit holder that \ndoes not use its entire allocation can save credits for future expansion, use them in other parts of its operation, or sell them to other", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4200, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fefb271-8c9b-47a8-bfa4-a7a222c7bbf6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fefb271-8c9b-47a8-bfa4-a7a222c7bbf6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "460", "file_name": "G.

The ef-fectiveness of such programs depends on how high or low the initial cap is set and on the rate at which the cap is regularly reduced to encourage further innovation.\nWe Can Reduce Pollution and Resource \nWaste by Selling Services Instead of Things\nOne approach to working toward more environmentally \nbeneficial economies is to sell certain services in place of the products that provide those services. With this ap-proach, a manufacturer or service provider makes more money if the production of its product involves minimal material use and pollution, and if the product lasts, is en-ergy efficient, produces as little pollution as possible while in use, and is easy to maintain, repair, reuse, or recycle.\nSuch an economic shift is under way in some busi-\nnesses. Since 1992, Xerox has been leasing most of its copy machines as part of its mission to provide document services instead of selling photocopiers. When a customer\u2019s service contract expires, Xerox takes the machine back for reuse or remanufacture. It has a goal of sending no material to landfills or incinerators. To save money, Xerox designs machines to have the fewest possible parts, be energy ef-ficient, and emit as little noise, heat, ozone, and chemical waste as possible.\nIn Europe, Carrier has begun shifting from selling \nheating and air conditioning equipment to providing in-door heating and cooling services. The company makes higher profits by leasing and installing energy-efficient equipment that is durable and easy to rebuild or recycle. Carrier also makes money through helping clients to save energy by adding insulation, eliminating heat losses, and boosting energy efficiency in their offices and homes.\nReducing Poverty Would Help Us to Deal \nwith Environmental Problems\nPoverty is defined as the condition under which people \ncannot meet their basic economic needs. According to the World Bank, poverty is the way of life for nearly half of the world\u2019s people who have to live on incomes equivalent to less than $2.25 per day. One fifth of the world\u2019s people live in extreme poverty (Figure 17.9), struggling to survive on incomes of less than $1.25 a day or on no income at all.\nSome analysts are alarmed at the widening gap be-\ntween rich and poor countries and between super-rich individuals and the rest of the world. In 2014, Oxfam re-ported that the richest 85 people in the world had as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion people\u2014half the world\u2019s \nWealthy polluters \nand resource users can buy their way out\nCaps can be too high \nand not regularly reduced to promote progress\nSelf-monitoring of \nemissions can allow cheatingFlexible and easy to administer\nEncourage \npollution prevention and waste reduction\nPermit prices to \nbe determined by market transactionsAdvantages Disadvantages\nTradable Environmental PermitsTrade-Offs\nFIGURE 17.8   Using tradable pollution and resource-use permits to \nreduce pollution and resource waste has advantages and disadvan-\ntages.

Her nonprofit organization has distributed waterless composting toilets throughout the country to collect hu-man wastes and transform them into compost, which Haitian farmers can use to rebuild depleted soil and boost food production. This process also keeps human wastes out of Haiti\u2019s water supply and reduces the dangerous threat of waterborne infectious diseases.\nCASE STUDY\nMicrolending\nMost of the world\u2019s poor people want to work and earn enough to climb out of poverty and make a better life for themselves and their families. But few of them have credit records or assets that they could use as collateral to secure the loans that they could use to buy what they would need to start farming or to start small businesses.\nFor over three decades, an innovation called microlend-\ning, or microfinance, has helped a number of people living in poverty to deal with this problem. In 1983, economist Muhammad Yunus started the Grameen (Village) Bank in Bangladesh, a country with a high poverty rate and a rap-idly growing population. Unlike commercial banks, the Grameen Bank is essentially owned and run by borrowers and by the Bangladeshi government. Since it was founded, the bank has provided more than $8 billion in microloans of $50 to $500 at low interest rates to 7.6 million impov-erished people in Bangladesh who do not qualify for loans at traditional banks.\nAbout 97% of these loans have been used by women, \nmostly to start small businesses, to plant crops, to buy small irrigation pumps, to buy cows and chickens for pro-ducing and selling milk and eggs, or to buy bicycles for transportation.

The United States\u2014the \nworld\u2019s richest country\u2014gives only 0.16% of its national income to help poor countries; Japan, another wealthy country, gives only 0.18% compared with the 0.9% given by Sweden. For any country, deciding whether or not to commit 0.7% of annual national income toward the Mil-lennium Development Goals is an ethical issue that re-quires individuals and nations to evaluate their priorities (Figure 17.10). The United States and China could set an example by increasing their nonmilitary aid to poor coun-tries (Core Case Study).\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT The Millennium Development Goals\nDo you think the country where you live should devote at least 0.7% of its an-\nnual national income toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals? Explain.\nWe Can Use Lessons from Nature to Shift \nto More Environmentally Sustainable Economies\nThe three scientific laws governing matter and energy \nchanges (see Chapter 2, pp. 33 and 35\u201337) and the six principles of sustainability (see Supplement 7, \npp. S50\u2013S51) suggest that the best long-term solution to our environmental and resource problems is to shift away from a high-throughput (high-waste) economy based on ever-increasing matter and energy flow. Our goal would be to develop a low-throughput (low-waste) economy that would work with nature to reduce excessive through-put, inefficient use of matter and energy resources, and the resulting pollution and wastes. Another goal could be to reuse, recycle, and compost most of our solid wastes (Figure 17.11).\nThe drive to improve environmental quality and to \nwork toward environmental sustainability has created new major growth industries along with profits and large numbers of new green jobs (Figure 17.12). While the United States was once a leader in the green economy, other countries including Germany and China (Core Case Study) have taken the lead in some areas, such as wind and solar energy development. However, according to Ethan Pollack of the Economic Policy Institute, by 2010, there were more than 3.1 million green jobs in the United States and that number has been rising.\nMaking the shift to more sustainable economies will \nrequire governments and industries to greatly increase their spending on research and development\u2014especially in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy\u2014as Germany has done in recent years. The shift toward sus-tainability will also require business leaders to understand why such a shift is important ecologically and economi-cally (Individuals Matter 17.1).$8 billion U.S. cosmetics\n$7.2 billion U.S. EPA$27 billion U.S. foreign aid$39 billion U.S. dog food\n$22 billionU.S. potato chips\nand similar snacksWorld military $1.4 trillionExpenditures\nper year (2008)\n$734 billion U.S. military\nU.S. highways $29 billion\n$243 billionTotal Earth Restoration and Social BudgetProvide basic\nhealth care for all$33 billion\n$37 billionProvide clean drinking water\nand sewage treatment for allProtect biodiversity $31 billionProtect topsoil on cropland $24 billionProvide universal\nprimary education and\neliminate illiteracy$14 billionRestore fisheries $13 billionDeal with global HIV/AIDS $10 billionStabilize water tables $10 billion$8 billion$6 billion\nProtect tropical forestsReforest the earth\nRestore rangelands $9 billion\nEliminate hunger\nand malnutrition$48 billionExpendituresper year needed to\nFIGURE 17.10   What should our priorities be?

Politics is the process by which \nindividuals and groups try to influence or control the poli-cies and actions of governments at local, state, national, and international levels. One important application of this process is the development of environmental policy\u2014\nenvironmental laws, regulations, and programs that are designed, implemented, and enforced by one or more government agencies.\nHere, we focus primarily on how policies are devel-\noped within a representative democracy\u2014a govern-ment run by the people through elected officials and representatives. This form of government has often been compromised by groups or organizations that gain enough wealth and power to have more influence over govern-ment policies than the average citizen can have. However, the ideals for representative democracy are usually em-bodied in a document called a constitution, which provides the basis of government authority and, in most cases, limits government power by mandating free elections and guaranteeing the right of free speech. Another name for such a government is constitutional democracy.\nindividuals matter 17.1 \nRay Anderson\nRay Anderson (1934\u20132011), founder of the American company Interface, was one of the \nworld\u2019s most respected and effective leaders in the movement to make businesses more sustainable. The company is the world\u2019s largest commercial manufacturer of carpet tiles, with 25 factories in 7 countries, and customers in 110 countries.\nAnderson changed the way he viewed the world\u2014and his business\u2014after reading \nPaul Hawken\u2019s book \nThe Ecology of Commerce.  In 1994, he announced plans to develop \nthe nation\u2019s first totally sustainable corporation. Within 16 years, Interface had cut its water usage by 74%, its net greenhouse gas emissions by 32%, its solid waste by 63%, its fossil fuel use by 60%, and its energy use by 44%. The company now gets 31% of its total energy from renewable resources. These efforts have saved Interface more than $433 million.\nAnderson also sent his carpet design team into the forest and told them to learn how \nnature would design floor covering. The team observed that there were no regularly re-peating patterns on the forest floor and that instead, there was disorder and diver-  \nsity. They had discovered nature\u2019s biodiversity principle of sustainability.  With  \nthis in mind, the design team created a line of carpet tiles, no two of which had the same design. Within 18 months after it was introduced, this new product line was the company\u2019s top-selling design.\nInterface also applies nature\u2019s chemical cycling principle of sustainability by making its carpet tiles from recycled fibers. And \nthe carpet tile factory runs partly on solar energy, thus applying another of nature\u2019s sustainability principles. In addition, the company invented a new carpet recycling process that does not emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.\nUnder Anderson\u2019s leadership, Interface became the world\u2019s largest seller of carpet tiles and profits tripled. Anderson also created a \nnew consulting group as part of Interface to help other businesses start on the path toward becoming more sustainable. He was an exemplary leader in the practice of upcycling\u2014working not only to reduce his company\u2019s ecological footprint but to create a large and expanding positive environmental impact.\nBackground photo: wanchai/Shutterstock.com\nInterface, Inc.\n90446_ch17_452-484.indd   465 8/13/14   11:21 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In the United States, for ex-ample, rapid and destabilizing change is curbed by a system of checks and balances that distributes power among three branches of government\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial\u2014and among federal, state, and local governments.\nThe major function of government in democratic coun-\ntries is to develop and implement policies for dealing with various issues. A typical policy life cycle consists of four stages:\n\u2022\tProblem recognition. A problem is identified by members \nof the public or by a lawmaker or executive.\n\u2022\tPolicy formulation. A cause or causes of the problem are identified and a solution such as a law or program to help deal with the problem is proposed and developed.\n\u2022\tPolicy implementation. A law is passed to put the solution into effect. A legislative body then provides funds for implementing and enforcing the new law, and the appropriate government department or agency must draw up regulations or rules for implementing it.\n\u2022\tPolicy adjustment. The new program is monitored, evaluated, and adjusted as necessary.\nIn passing laws, developing budgets, and formulating \nregulations, elected and appointed government officials \nmust deal with pressure from many competing special-\n \ninterest groups. Each of these groups advocates for the pas-sage of certain laws, for receipt of subsidies or tax breaks, and for regulations favorable to its cause. Such groups also seek to weaken or repeal laws, subsidies, tax breaks, and regulations that are unfavorable to their positions. Impor -\ntant examples of special-interest groups include profit-making organizations, such as corporations; nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), most of which are nonprofit organiza-tions such as environmental groups; labor unions, repre-senting the interests of workers; and trade associations, representing various industries.\nAs they have evolved, most democratic governments \nhave taken on features that hinder their ability to deal with environmental problems (see the Case Study that fol-lows). Such problems are usually invisible or difficult to understand, as well as intertwined in complex ways, and they can have long-lasting effects and require integrated, long-term solutions. However, most politicians spend much of their time seeking reelection and tend to focus on short-term, isolated issues rather than on long-term, com-plex problems. Also, political leaders, with hundreds of issues to deal with, usually have little or no understanding of how the earth\u2019s natural systems work and how those systems support all life, economies, and societies.\nBy comparison, even though it has shifted partially to \na market-based economy, China has a far more central-ized, less democratic government, without the checks and balances of Western democracies. Change there can occur more quickly, as policies are developed by the central gov-ernment with little public input. This has helped the Chi-nese economy to grow rapidly, but it has also led to major environmental problems (Core Case Study).\nBecause of its strong central government, public pro-\ntest in China has been limited. However, as China\u2019s rapidly expanding middle class gains more economic power, it is putting pressure on the government to do something about increasingly intolerable environmental conditions. To reduce the growing threat of civil unrest in this rapidly urbanizing country, the government will have to put much greater emphasis on dealing with its serious envi-ronmental problems, as the United States did in the 1970s.\nCASE STUDY\nManaging Public Lands in the United \nStates\u2014Politics in Action\nNo nation has set aside as much of its land for public use, \nresource extraction, enjoyment, or wildlife habitat as has the United States.

Other research has shown that, in general, toxic waste sites in white communities have been cleaned up faster and more completely than similar sites in African American and Latino communities have. In China, this problem is worse (Core Case Study). Because of intolerable pollution in urban areas, many factories in China are being moved to the countryside, and rates of cancer and other seri-ous human illnesses are rising sharply in these rural areas.\nSuch environmental discrimination in many parts of \nthe world has led to a growing grassroots effort known as the environmental justice movement. Supporters of this move-\nment have pressured governments, businesses, and envi-ronmental organizations to become aware of environmental injustice and to act to prevent it. They have made some progress toward their goals, but have a long way to go.\nSome politicians and business representatives suggest \nthat economics should be the main factor in decisions about where to locate power plants, freeways, landfills, incinerators, and other such potentially disruptive facili-ties, arguing that they can cut costs by locating them in less desirable areas. Often, however, such areas are home to low-income residents who have much less political power than do developers and corporations. Many ana-lysts argue that an ethical principle of environmental jus-tice should carry as much weight as economic factors do in such decisions. This is a political struggle that is still unre-solved in many areas of the world.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Environmental Justice\nDo you think that the principles of environmental justice should get equal \nweight, more weight, or less weight in political decisions about where to lo-cate potentially environmentally harmful facilities such as incinerators? Explain.\nCertain Principles Can Guide Us in Making \nEnvironmental Policy\nAnalysts suggest that when evaluating existing or pro-\nposed environmental policies, legislators and individuals should be guided by seven principles designed to reduce environmental harm:\n\u2022\tThe reversibility principle: Avoid making decisions that \ncannot be reversed later if they turn out to be harmful. For example, two essentially irreversible actions are the production of indestructible, toxic coal ash in coal-burning power plants, and the production of deadly radioactive wastes throughout the nuclear power fuel cycle. In both cases, the hazardous wastes must be stored safely for thousands of years.\n\u2022\tThe net energy principle: Avoid the widespread use of energy resources and technologies with low or negative net energy yields (see Figure 13.2, p. 315), which cannot compete in the open marketplace without government subsidies and tax breaks. Examples of such energy alternatives include nuclear power (considering the whole fuel cycle), tar sands, shale oil, ethanol made from corn, and hydrogen fuel, as discussed in Chapter 13.\n\u2022\tThe precautionary principle: When substantial evidence indicates that an activity threatens human health or the environment, take precautionary measures to prevent or reduce such harm, even if some of the cause-and-effect relationships are not well established, scientifically.\n\u2022\tThe prevention principle: Make decisions that help to prevent a problem from occurring or becoming worse.\n\u2022\tThe polluter-pays principle: Develop regulations and use economic tools such as green taxes to ensure that polluters bear the costs of dealing with the pollutants and wastes they produce in accordance with the  \nfull-cost pricing principle of sustainability.  This  \nalso stimulates the development of innovative ways to reduce and prevent pollution and wastes.\n\u2022\tThe environmental justice principle: In implementing environmental policy, no group of people should bear an unfair share of the burden created by pollution, environmental", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4109, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c007e6e-4065-4414-b365-c645add43b3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c007e6e-4065-4414-b365-c645add43b3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "469", "file_name": "G.

This ethical principle also addresses environmental injustices committed by one generation and affecting future generations, and thus it echoes the future generations principle of sustainability.\n\u2022\tThe holistic principle: Recognize that the environmental and other problems we face are connected. Thus, we need to focus on long-term solutions that address root causes of such interconnected problems instead of focusing on short-term and often ineffective fixes that treat each problem separately.\nImplementing such principles is not easy and requires \npolicy makers throughout the world to become more en-\nvironmentally literate. It also requires robust debate among politicians and citizens, mutual respect for diverse beliefs, and a dedication to implementing the win-win principle of sustainability. This would replace \nthe more polarized I-win-you-lose approach that fails to recognize that the solutions to urgent environmental problems will require openness, inclusiveness, innovation, and compromise among political players and other people with divergent views.\nCONSIDER THIS. . .\nTHINKING ABOUT Environmental Political Principles\nWhich three of the seven principles listed here do you think are the most im-\nportant?

His-\ntory shows that significant change usually comes from the \nbottom up when individuals join together to bring about change. Without previous bottom-up, or grassroots, politi-cal action by millions of individual citizens and organized citizen groups (Figure 17.15), the air that millions of peo-ple breathe today and the water they drink would be much more polluted, and much more of the earth\u2019s biodi-versity would have disappeared (Concept 17.3). (See the Case Study that follows.)\nWith the growth of the Internet, digital technology, \nand social media, individuals have become more empow-ered. Partly because of this social networking, the number of citizens\u2019 groups, national and global action networks, and NGOs focused on environmental and other problems has grown rapidly. In some instances, what people have done to improve environmental quality in their own neighborhoods, schools, or workplaces has inspired ac-tions on regional, national, and global stages. Figure 17.16 lists ways in which individuals living in constitutional de-mocracies have influenced government policies.\nEach of us can provide environmental leadership in \nseveral different ways. First, we can lead by example, using our own lifestyles and values to show others that change is possible and can be beneficial. For example, we can use fewer disposable products, eat food that has been sustain-ably produced (see Figure 10.27, p. 242), and walk, bike, or take mass transit to work or school. We can reuse and recycle many items, and we can reduce our matter and energy consumption by thinking more about whether we should limit more of our purchases to things we really need. In addition to setting a good example, we can also save money and expand our beneficial environmental im-pacts by taking such steps.\nSecond, we can work within existing economic and political \nsystems to bring about environmental improvement by cam-paigning and voting for informed and ecologically literate candidates, and by communicating with elected officials. As environmental writer and activist Bill McKibben says, \u201cFirst change your politicians, then worry about your lightbulbs.\u201d We can also send a message to companies that we feel are harming the environment through their pro-duction processes or products by voting with our wallets\u2014not buying their products or services\u2014and letting them know why. Another way to work within the system is to choose one of the many rapidly growing green careers highlighted throughout this book and described in Figure 17.12 and on this book\u2019s companion website.\nThird, we can run for some sort of local office. Look in the \nmirror. Maybe you are one of those who can make a dif-ference as an officeholder.\nFourth, we can propose and work for better solutions to \nenvironmental problems. Leadership is much more than just \nFIGURE 17.15   Marchers in New York City in 2011 protesting against natural gas fracking.\nDavid Grossman/Alamy\nGrassroots political action has led \nto improvements in environmental quality in many countries.\n90446_ch17_452-484.indd   470 8/13/14   11:21 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

It is represented by one of \nthe first and most far-reaching federal environmental laws, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, passed in 1970. Under NEPA, an environmental impact state-ment (EIS) must be developed for every major federal proj-ect likely to have an effect on environmental quality. The EIS must identify, and suggest ways to lessen, any harmful impacts, and it must present an evaluation of alternatives to the project.\nThe second major type of environmental legislation sets \nstandards for pollution levels (as in the Clean Air Acts, see Chapter 15, p. 399). A third type sets aside or protects certain species, resources, and ecosystems (the Endangered Species Act, see Chapter 8, p. 177, and the Wilderness Act, see Chapter 9, p. 200). A fourth type screens new substances for safety and sets \nstandards (as in the Safe Drinking Water Act). And a fifth type encourages resource conservation (the Resource Conser -\nvation and Recovery Act, see Chapter 16, p. 445).\nU.S. environmental laws have been highly effective, \nespecially in controlling some forms of pollution. However, since 1980, a well-organized and well-funded movement has mounted a strong campaign to weaken or repeal exist-ing U.S. environmental laws and regulations and to change the ways in which public lands (Figure 17.14) are used.\nThree major groups are strongly opposed to various \nU.S. environmental laws and regulations: (1) some corpo-rate leaders and owners who see them as threats to their profits, wealth, and power; (2) citizens who see them as threats both to their private property rights and jobs; and (3) state and local government officials who resent having to implement federal laws and regulations with little or no federal funding, or who disagree with certain federal regulations.\nOne problem working against effective regulations is \nthat the focus of environmental issues has shifted from easy-to-see, dirty smokestacks and filthy rivers to more complex, long-term, and less visible environmental prob-lems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and ground-water pollution. Explaining such complex issues to the public and mobilizing support for often controversial, long-range solutions to such problems is difficult. (See the online Guest Essay on environmental reporting by An-drew C. Revkin.)\nAnother problem is that some environmentalists have \nprimarily brought bad news about the state of the environ-ment to the general public. History shows that bearers of bad news are not well received, and opponents of the en-vironmental movement have used this to undermine en-vironmental concerns. History also shows that people are moved to bring about change mostly by inspiring, power -\nful, and hopeful messages about what the world could be like. \nGREEN CAREER:  Environmental writer\nSince 2000, efforts to weaken U.S. environmental laws \nand regulations have escalated. Nevertheless, independent polls show that more than 80% of the U.S. public strongly support environmental laws and regulations and do not want them weakened. However, polls also show that less than 10% of the U.S. public (and in economic downturns only about 2\u20133%) considers the environment to be one of the nation\u2019s most pressing problems. As a result, environ-mental concerns often do not get transferred to the ballot box or to personal spending decisions.\nCitizen Environmental Groups Play \nImportant Roles\nThe spearheads of the global conservation, environmental, \nand environmental justice movements are the tens of thousands of nonprofit NGOs working at the international, national, state, and local levels. The growing influence of these organizations is one of the most important factors in the forging of environmental decisions and policies.\nNGOs range in size from grassroots groups with just a \nfew members to mainline organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a 5-million-member global conserva-tion organization that", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4046, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f93cd32a-a00d-44eb-9224-e7e02b420c00": {"__data__": {"id_": "f93cd32a-a00d-44eb-9224-e7e02b420c00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "472", "file_name": "G.

They have helped to persuade Congress to pass and strengthen environmental laws (Figure 17.17), and they fight attempts to weaken or repeal these laws. Taken to-gether, a loosely connected worldwide network of grassroots NGOs working for bottom-up political, social, economic, and environmental change can be viewed as an emerg-ing citizen-based global sustainability movement.\nStudents and Educational Institutions Can \nPlay Important Environmental Roles\nCampus environmental groups have been leading the way \non hundreds of campuses as they seek to make their schools and local communities more sustainable (see Chapter 1 Core Case Study, p. 4).\nMany student groups make environmental audits of their \ncampuses or schools. They gather data on practices affect-ing the environment and use them to propose changes that will make their campuses or schools more environ-mentally sustainable while usually saving money in the process. Such audits have focused on implementing or improving recycling programs, convincing university food services to buy more food from local organic farms, shift-ing from fossil fuels to renewable energy, retrofitting buildings to make them more energy efficient, and imple-menting concepts of environmental sustainability through-out the curriculum.\nOther students have focused on institutional invest-\nments.

However, ecologists and many econo-\nmists point out that all economies are supported by the earth\u2019s natural capital (Figure 17.4). Thus, environmental security, economic security, and national security are interrelated.\nAccording to environmental scientist Norman Myers:\nIf a nation\u2019s environmental foundations are degraded or de-\npleted, its economy may well decline, its social fabric deterio-rate, and its political structure become destabilized as growing numbers of people seek to sustain themselves from declining resource stocks. Thus, national security is no longer about fighting forces and weaponry alone. It relates increasingly to watersheds, croplands, forests, genetic resources, climate, and other factors that, taken together, are as crucial to a nation\u2019s security as are military factors.\nMyers and other analysts call for all countries to make \nenvironmental security a major focus of diplomacy and \ngovernment policy at all levels. (See Myers\u2019 online Guest Essay on this subject.)\nA 2014 article by Foreign Policy in Focus and TheNation \n.com warned that the United States does not have ade-quate safety rules and inspection and maintenance pro-grams for protecting many of the dangerous and environmentally harmful materials it has produced and facilities it has built since 1950. This includes toxic chemi-cal dumps, nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants, radio-active waste storage facilities (see Figure 13.19, p. 329), oil and gas pipelines, oil refineries, and offshore oil rigs. This is partly because not enough citizens or lobbyists have pressured Congress to pass regulations or to designate funds for improving security around these facilities.\nA number of international environmental organizations \nhelp to shape and set global environmental policy and \n improve environmental security and sustainability.

These conflicts arise mostly out of differing environmental worldviews\u2014ways of thinking about how the world works and beliefs that people hold about their roles in the natural world. People with differing environmental worldviews can take the same data, be logically consistent in their analysis of those data, and arrive at quite different conclusions be-cause they start with different assumptions and values.\nAn environmental worldview is determined partly by \na person\u2019s environmental ethics\u2014what one believes about what is right and what is wrong in our behavior toward the environment. According to environmental ethicist Robert Cahn:\nThe main ingredients of an environmental ethic are caring about the planet and all of its inhabitants, allowing unself-ishness to control the immediate self-interest that harms oth-ers, and living each day so as to leave the lightest possible footprints on the planet.\nEnvironmental ethics are playing an increasingly im-\nportant role in many political and economic decisions that \naffect the environment. For example, China and the United States both have abundant reserves of coal (Core Case Study). People with one ethical view argue that China has the right to exploit its coal resource to help drive fur -\nther economic growth, much in the way that the United States has done. However, those with a different ethical view contend that China should not burn all of its coal, because the resulting CO\n2 emissions could push the world \npast a dangerous climate change tipping point (see Figure 15.28, p. 415). Others also argue that the United States and other countries with large coal reserves should not burn all of their coal. Ethical issues such as this one pre\n-\nsent difficult challenges to the world\u2019s decision makers. \nGREEN CAREER:  Environmental ethicist\nSome Environmental Worldviews Are \nHuman-Centered\nA human-centered (anthropocentric) worldview is \none that is focused primarily on the needs and wants of \npeople. One such worldview, called the planetary manage-ment worldview, sees humans as the planet\u2019s most impor -\ntant species\u2014the one that can and should dominate and manage the earth, mostly for its own benefit. This view holds that other species and parts of nature are to be evaluated according to how useful they are to humans.\nAnother human-centered environmental worldview is \nthe stewardship worldview. It assumes that we have an ethical \nresponsibility to be caring and responsible managers, or stew-ards, of the earth. According to this view, when we use the earth\u2019s natural capital, we are borrowing from the earth and from future generations. Thus, we have an ethical responsi-bility to pay this debt by leaving the earth\u2019s life-support sys-tem in as good a condition as what we now enjoy or better.\nSome people contend that any human-centered world-\nview will eventually fail because it wrongly assumes we now have or can gain enough knowledge to become effec-tive managers or stewards of the earth. Critics of human-centered worldviews point out that we do not even know how many plant and animal species live on the earth, much less what their roles are, how they interact with one another and their nonliving environment, and how they support our lives and economies. As biologist David Eh-renfeld puts it, \u201cIn no important instance have we been able to demonstrate comprehensive successful manage-ment of the world, nor do we understand it well enough to manage it even in theory.\u201d This position is illustrated by the failure of the Biosphere 2 project (Science Focus 17.1).\nSome Environmental Worldviews  \nAre", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4033, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e4e4c80-cf35-4716-8832-892f24d1e95c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e4e4c80-cf35-4716-8832-892f24d1e95c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "474", "file_name": "G.

However, most \npeople who hold a life-centered worldview believe we have an ethical responsibility to avoid hastening the extinction of any species through our activities, for two reasons. First,  \neach species is a unique package of genetic information that should be respected and protected because it is part of a genetic storehouse that will help the earth\u2019s life to con-tinue by changing in response to changes in environmental conditions. Second, every species has the potential for pro-\nviding economic benefits directly or indirectly through its participation in providing ecosystem services.\nPeople with earth-centered worldviews believe we \nhave an ethical responsibility to take a wider view and to try to preserve the earth\u2019s biodiversity and the functioning of its life-support systems for the benefit of all forms of life, now and in the future. They argue that humans are not in charge of the world and that human economies and other systems are subsystems of the biosphere (Figure 17.4) and \n90446_ch17_452-484.indd   474 8/13/14   11:21 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

(See the online Guest Essay on this topic by Lester W. Mil-brath.) This begins by understanding that we are part of, not apart from, the earth, and that we are utterly depen-dent on the earth\u2019s natural capital.\nSciEncEFocus17.1\nBIOSPHERE 2\u2014A LESSON IN HUMILITY\nIn 1991, eight scientists (four men and \nfour women) were sealed inside Bio-\nsphere 2, a $200 million glass and steel enclosure designed to be a self-sustaining life-support system (Figure 17.A) that would increase our under -\nstanding of Biosphere 1\u2014the earth\u2019s  \nlife-support system.\nThis sealed system of intercon-\nnected domes was built in the desert near Tucson, Arizona. It contained arti-ficial ecosystems including a tropical rain forest, a savanna, a desert, a lake, streams, freshwater and saltwater wet-lands, and a mini-ocean with a coral reef.\nBiosphere 2 was designed to mimic \nthe earth\u2019s natural chemical cycling sys-tems. Water evaporated from its ocean and other aquatic systems and then condensed to provide rainfall over the tropical rain forest. The precipitation trickled through soil filters into the marshes and back into the mini-ocean before beginning the cycle again.\nThe facility was stocked with more \nthan 4,000 species of plants and ani-mals, including small primates, chick-ens, cats, and insects, selected to help maintain life-support functions. Human and animal excrement and other wastes were treated and recycled to help support plant growth. Sunlight and external natural gas\u2013powered  generators provided en-ergy. The Biospherians were to be isolated for  \n2 years and to raise their own food using intensive organic agriculture. They were to breathe air recir\n-\nculated by plants and to drink water cleansed by natural chemical recycling processes.\nFrom the beginning, many unex-\npected problems cropped up and the life-support system began to unravel. The level of oxygen in the air declined with soil organisms converting it to carbon dioxide. Additional oxygen had to be pumped in from the outside  \nto keep the Biospherians from suffocating.\nTropical birds died after the first \nfreeze. An ant species got into the en-closure, proliferated, and killed off most of the system\u2019s original insect species. In total, 19 of the Biosphere\u2019s 25 small animal species became ex-tinct. Before the 2-year period was over, all plant-pollinating insects be-came extinct, thereby dooming to ex-tinction most of the plant species.\nDespite many problems, the facility\u2019s \nwaste and wastewater were recycled. With much hard work, the Biospheri-ans were also able to produce 80% of their food supply. However, they suf-fered from persistent hunger and weight loss.\nIn the end, an expenditure of $200 \nmillion failed to maintain a life-support system for eight people for 2 years. Ecologists Joel Cohen and David Til-man, who evaluated the project, con-cluded, \u201cNo one yet knows how to engineer systems that provide humans with life-supporting services that natu-ral ecosystems provide for free.\u201d\nCritical Thinking\nSome analysts argue that the problems with Biosphere 2 resulted mostly from inadequate design and that a better team of scientists and engineers could make it work.

Part of the problem stems from our incomplete understanding of how the earth\u2019s life-support system works, how our actions affect its life-sustaining systems, and how we can change our be-havior toward the earth and thus toward ourselves. Improv-ing this understanding begins by grasping three important ideas that form the foundation of environmental literacy:\n1.\n Natural capital matters because it supports the earth\u2019s \nlife and our economies.\n2. Our ecological footprints are immense and are expanding rapidly.\n3.\n We should not exceed any of the estimated planetary boundaries or ecological tipping points (see Figure 3.A, p. 58, and Figure 15.28, p. 415). Once we cross such points, neither wealth nor technology can save us from the resulting consequences that could last for hundreds to thousands of years.\nLearning how to live more sustainably requires a foun-\ndation of environmental education aimed at producing \nenvironmentally literate citizens. We hope that, with this course and textbook, you have begun to build your foun-dation and we encourage you to keep learning about the environment throughout your life.\nWe Can Learn from the Earth\nFormal environmental education is important, but is it enough? Many analysts say no. They call for us to appreci-ate not only the economic value of nature, but also its eco-logical, aesthetic, and spiritual values. To these analysts, the problem is not just a lack of environmental literacy but also, for many people, a lack of intimate contact with nature and an incomplete understanding of how nature works and sustains us. This can reduce our ability to act more respon-sibly toward the earth and thus toward ourselves.\nA growing chorus of analysts suggest that we have much \nto learn from nature. They call for us to acquire a sense of awe, wonder, mystery, excitement, and humility by stand-ing under the stars, exploring a forest, enjoying a beautiful scene in nature (Figure 17.19), or taking in the majesty and power of the sea. We might pick up a handful of topsoil and try to sense the teeming microscopic life within it that helps to keep us alive by supporting food production. We might look at a tree, a mountain (see chapter-opening photo), a rock, or a bee, or listen to the sound of a bird and try to sense how each of them is connected to us and we to them, through the earth\u2019s life-sustaining processes.\nSuch direct experiences with nature can reveal parts of \nthe complex web of life that cannot be bought, re-created with technology, or reproduced with genetic engineering. Understanding and directly experiencing the precious and free gifts we receive from nature can help us to make an ethical commitment to live more sustainably on this earth.\nSome psychologists and other thinkers argue that such \ndirect experience and understanding of nature is necessary for healthy living. Journalist Richard Louv, who has spe-cialized in studying relationships among family, commu-nity, and nature, coined the term nature-deficit disorder  \nto describe a wide range of problems, including anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit disorders that might be resulting from a lack of contact with nature.

Louv and others urge us to reconnect with nature, as many people do through birdwatching, taking photographs of what they enjoy in nature, hiking or biking through natu-ral areas, camping, canoeing, snorkeling (see this book\u2019s cover photo), and gardening.\nWe Can Live More Simply and Lightly on \nthe Earth\nOn a time scale of hundreds of thousands to millions of \nyears, the earth is very resilient and can survive the envi-ronmental wounds we are inflicting. However, scientists warn that if we continue on our current path, within your lifetime, it is very likely that we will be living on a changed planet with a warmer and sometimes harsher climate, less dependable supplies of water, more acidic oceans, exten-sive soil degradation, a sixth mass extinction underway, degradation of key ecosystem services, and widespread ecological and economic disruption.\nSome analysts urge people who have a habit of con-\nsuming excessively to learn how to live more simply and lightly. Seeking happiness through the pursuit of material things is considered folly by almost every major religion and philosophy. Yet, today\u2019s avalanche of advertising mes-sages encourage people to buy more and more things to fill a growing list of wants as a way to achieve happiness.

Many of these people view voluntary simplicity not as a sacrifice but as a way to have a more fulfilling and satisfying life. Instead of working longer to pay for bigger vehicles and houses, they are spend-ing more time with their loved ones, friends, and neighbors.\nPracticing voluntary simplicity is a way to apply the \nIndian philosopher and leader Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s principle of enoughness: \u201cThe earth provides enough to satisfy every person\u2019s need but not every person\u2019s greed. . . .

Here are five of those guidelines\u2014all of them in keeping with all six prin-ciples of sustainability (see Figure 1.2, p. 6, and Figure 1.5, p. 9, or Supplement 7, pp. S50\u2013S51):\n1.\n Mimic the ways in which nature sustains itself and \nconsider the effects that certain activities will have on other people and other life forms, present and future.\n2.\n Protect the earth\u2019s natural capital and repair ecological damage caused by human activities.\n3.\n Use matter and energy resources as efficiently as possible.\n4.\n Celebrate and protect biodiversity.\n5. Leave the earth in a condition that is as good as what we have enjoyed, or better.\nThroughout this text, you have encountered lists of \nsteps we can take to live more lightly by reducing the size \nand impact of our ecological footprints on the earth. It would be difficult for most of us to do all or even most of these things. So which ones are the most important? The human activities that have the greatest harmful impacts on the environment are food production, transportation, home energy use, and our overall resource use. Based on this analysis, Figure 17.21 lists eight key ways in which some people are choosing to live more simply to try to make beneficial environmental impacts.\nIt is important to recognize that there is no single cor -\nrect or best solution to each of the environmental prob-lems we face. Indeed, one of nature\u2019s three scientific principles of sustainability holds that preserving diversity\u2014in this case, being flexible and adaptable in trying a variety of cultural, economic, political, and technological solutions to our problems\u2014is the best way to adapt to the earth\u2019s largely unpredictable, ever-changing environmental conditions.

Now, in this century, environmental leaders say it is time for another global transformation\u2014a sustainability revolution. Here is what business entrepreneur and envi-ronmental writer Paul Hawken told the 2009 graduating class at the University of Portland:\nWhen asked if I am pessimistic or optimistic about the future, my answer is always the same: If you look at the science about what is happening on the earth and aren\u2019t pessimistic, you don\u2019t understand the data. But if you meet the people who are working to restore this earth and the lives of the poor, and you aren\u2019t optimistic, you haven\u2019t got a pulse. . . . You join a mul-titude of caring people.\nFigure 17.22 lists some of the major cultural shifts in \nemphasis that could help to bring about a sustainability \nrevolution. One of the leaders in the movement to develop and promote detailed plans for making the shift to more sustainable ways of living is Lester R. Brown (Individuals Matter 17.2).\nWe know what needs to be done and we can change \nthe way we treat the earth and thus our life-support sys-tem. History also shows that we can bring about change faster than we might think, once we have the courage to leave behind ideas and practices that no longer work and to nurture new positive trends such as the rapidly growing seedlings of sustainability listed in Figure 17.23.FIGURE 17.21   Living \nmore lightly: Eight ways to \nshrink our ecological foot-prints and expand our ben-eficial environmental impacts (Concept 17.5).

Brown: Champion of Sustainability\nLester R. Brown is president of the Earth Policy Institute, which he founded in 2001. The \npurpose of this nonprofit, interdisciplinary research organization is to provide a plan for a more sustainable future and a roadmap showing how we could get there. In 1974, he founded the Worldwatch Institute, which publishes annual reports on environmental is-sues and has helped to educate citizens and national leaders throughout the world about the serious environmental problems we face.\nBrown is an interdisciplinary thinker and one of the pioneers of the global sustain-\nability movement. For decades, he has been researching and describing the complex and interconnected environmental issues we face and proposing concrete strategies for deal-ing with them. The \nWashington Post  has called him \u201cone of the world\u2019s most influential \nthinkers,\u201d and in 2011, Foreign Policy  named him one of the Top Global Thinkers.\nBrown\u2019s Plan B for shifting to a more environmentally and economically sustainable \nfuture has four main goals: (1) stabilize population growth, (2) stabilize climate change, (3) eradicate poverty, and (4) restore the earth\u2019s natural support systems.\nBrown has written or coauthored more than 50 books, which have been translated \ninto more than 40 languages. He has received numerous prizes and awards, including  \n25 honorary degrees, the United Nations Environment Prize, and Japan\u2019s Blue Planet Prize. In 2012, he was inducted into the Earth Hall of Fame in Kyoto, Japan. He also holds three honorary professorships in China.\nDespite the serious environmental challenges we face, Brown sees reasons for hope. They include his understanding that social \nchange can sometimes occur very quickly. He is also encouraged by improvements in fuel efficiency, the emerging shift from using coal to using solar and wind energy to produce electricity, and a growing public understanding of our need to live more sustainably.\nBackground photo: Petr Kopka/Shutterstock.com\nKFEM/Earth Policy Institute\n90446_ch17_452-484.indd   479 8/13/14   11:21 AMCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The governments and citizens of these countries can help to make such a transition by applying the scientific principles  of sustainability (see Figure 1.2, p. 6)\u2014relying much  \nmore on solar energy and other renewable energy sources, re-using and recycling much more of what is produced, and cel-ebrating, restoring, and protecting as much as possible of the biodiversity that supports our lives and economies.\nU.S. and Chinese policy makers and business leaders could \nalso be guided by the three social science principles of sus-tainability (see Figure 1.5, p. 9). In the political arena, they will have to try harder to find win-win solutions that benefit the largest numbers of people while also benefiting the environ-ment. Such solutions will likely include internalizing the harmful \nenvironmental and health costs of producing and using goods and services (full-cost pricing). And these decision makers, as well as all the rest of us, will need to make each decision with future genera-tions in mind\u2014seeking to leave the world in as good a condition as that which we now enjoy, if not better.TYING  IT ALL T OGETHER\nThe United States, China, and Sustainability\nRagnarock |", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4053, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52f18926-9d00-47e6-b9c1-15a253a37161": {"__data__": {"id_": "52f18926-9d00-47e6-b9c1-15a253a37161", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "481", "file_name": "G.

If you are nearing the end of this course, is your view of the future more hopeful or less hopeful than it was when you began this course? Compare your answers with those of your classmates.\nDoing Environmental Science\nChoose an environmental issue, such as water pollution, climate change, population growth, biodiversity loss, or any other issue that you have studied in this course. Con-duct a poll of students, faculty, staff, and local residents by asking them the questions that follow relating to your particular environmental issue. Poll as many people as you can in order to get a large sample. Create categories. For example, note whether each respondent is male or fe-male. By creating such categories, you are placing each person into a respondent pool. You can add other questions about age, political leaning, and other factors to refine your pools as you see fit.\nPoll Questions\nQuestion 1  On a scale of 1 to 10, how knowledgeable are you about environmental issue X?Question 2\n On a scale of 1 to 10, how aware are you of ways in which you, as an individual, impact environmental issue X?\nQuestion 3\n On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it for you to learn more about environmental issue X?\nQuestion 4\n On a scale of 1 to 10, how sure are you that an individual can have a positive influence on environmental issue X?\nQuestion 5\n On a scale of 1 to 10, how sure are you that the government is providing the appropriate level of leadership with regard to environmen-tal issue X?\n 1. Collect your data and analyze your findings to mea-sure any differences among the respondent pools.\n 2. List any major conclusions you would draw from the data.\n 3. Publicize your findings on your school\u2019s website or in the local newspaper.\nGlobal Environment Watch Exercise\nWithin the GREENR database, use the World Map feature, and under \u201cBrowse,\u201d select Sustainability. Click on the pins for the United States, Japan, China, India, and one other country of your choice and research what each of them is doing to try to become more sustainable. Which of these sustainability programs are working well? Which ones are not working well? Write a report comparing these pro-grams and include details on what is working and what is not working in each of the programs. Also, include your thoughts about why some are not working well and what could be done to make them more successful.\nEcological Footprint Analysis\nWorking with classmates, conduct an ecological footprint analysis of your campus. Work with a partner, or in small groups, to research and investigate one or more aspects of your school, such as recycling or composting; water use; food service practices; energy use; building management and energy conservation; transportation for both on- and off-campus trips; or grounds maintenance. Depending on your school and its location, you may want to add more areas to the investigation. You can also decide to study the campus as a whole, or to break it down into smaller research areas, such as dorms, administrative buildings, classroom buildings, grounds, and other areas. 1. After deciding on your group\u2019s research area, conduct your analysis. As part of your analysis, develop a list of questions that will help to determine the ecological im-pact related to your chosen topic. For example, with regard to water use, you might ask how much water is used, what is the estimated amount that is lost through leaking pipes and faucets, and what is the average monthly water bill for the school, among other ques-tions. Use such questions as a basis for your research.\n 2. Analyze your results and share them with the class to determine what can be done to shrink the ecologi-cal footprint of your school within the area you have chosen.\n 3.

This information, called data, is collected in experiments, surveys, and other information-gathering activ-ities. Graphing can be a powerful tool for summarizing and conveying complex information.\nIn this textbook and the accompanying web-based Active \nGraphing exercises, we use three major types of graphs: line graphs, bar graphs, and pie graphs. Here, you will explore each \nof these types of graphs and learn how to read them. In the web-based Active Graphing exercises, you can try your hand at creating some graphs.\nAn important visual tool used to summarize data that \nvary over small or large areas is a map. We discuss some aspects of reading maps relating to environmental science at the end of this supplement.\nLine Graphs\nLine graphs usually represent data that fall in some sort of sequence such as a series of measurements over time or dis-tance. In most such cases, units of time or distance lie on the horizontal x-axis. The possible measurements of some quan-\ntity or variable such as temperature or oil use that changes over time or distance usually lie on the vertical y-axis.\nIn Figure 1, the x-axis shows the years between 1965 and \n2020, and the y-axis displays a range of possible values for the annual amounts of oil consumed worldwide. Usually, the y-axis appears on the left end of the x-axis, although y-axes can appear on the right end, in the middle, or on both ends of the x-axis.\nThe curving line on a line graph represents the measure-\nments taken at certain time or distance intervals. In Figure 1, the curve represents changes in annual global oil consump-tion between 1965 and 2012. To find the average annual global oil consumption for any year, find that year on the x-axis (a point called the abscissa) and run a vertical line from the axis to the curve. At the point where your line intersects the curve, run a horizontal line to the y-axis. The value at that point on the y-axis, called the ordinate, is the amount you are seeking. You can go through the same process in reverse to find a year in which global oil consumption was at a certain point.\nQuestions\n 1. About how many metric tons of oil were consumed in the world in 2012?\n 2. Roughly how many times more oil was consumed in 2012 than in 1985? About how many times more oil was consumed in 2012 than in 1965?\nLine graphs have several important uses. One of the most \ncommon applications is to compare two or more variables. Figure 2 compares two variables: monthly temperature and precipitation (rain and snowfall) during a typical year in a temperate deciduous forest. However, in this case the vari-ables are measured on two different scales, so there are two y-axes. The y-axis on the left end of the graph shows a Centi-grade temperature scale, while the y-axis on the right shows the range of precipitation measurements in millimeters.

What are the two terrestrial ecosystems that are closest \nin NPP value of all pairs of such ecosystems? About how many times greater is the NPP in a tropical rain forest than the NPP in a savanna?\n 2. Which is the most productive of the aquatic ecosystems shown here? Which is the least productive?\nAn important application of the bar graph used in this \nbook is the age-structure diagram (see Figure 6.7, p. 108), which describes a population by showing the numbers of males and females in certain age groups (see Chapter 6,  \npp. 108\u2013110).\nPie Graphs\nLike bar graphs, pie graphs, or pie charts, illustrate numerical values for two or more categories. But in addition to that, they can also show each category\u2019s proportion of the total of all measurements. The categories are usually ordered on the graph from largest to smallest, for ease of comparison, although this is not always the case. Also, as with bar graphs, pie graphs are generally snapshots of a data set at a point in time or during a defined time period. Unlike line graphs, one pie graph cannot show changes over time.from what it is now (see Figure 7.14, center, p. 142)?\n \nIf the annual precipitation suddenly dropped and remained under 25 centimeters all year, what do you think would eventually happen to this forest?\nBar Graphs\nThe bar graph is used to compare measurements for one or \nmore variables across categories. Unlike the line graph, a bar graph typically does not involve a sequence of measurements over time or distance. The measurements compared on a bar graph usually represent data collected at some point in time or during a well-defined period. For instance, we can com-pare the net primary productivity (NPP), a measure of chemical energy produced by plants in an ecosystem, for different eco-systems, as represented in Figure 3.\nIn most bar graphs, the categories to be compared are laid \nout on the x-axis, while the range of measurements for the variable under consideration lies along the y-axis. In Figure 3, the categories (ecosystems) are on the y-axis, and the vari-able range (NPP) lies on the x-axis. In either case, reading the graph is straightforward. Simply run a line perpendicular to the bar you are reading from the top of that bar (or the right or left end, if it lies horizontally) to the variable value axis. In Figure 3, you can see that the NPP for the continental shelf, for example, is close to 1,600 kcal/m\n2/yr.Swamps and marshes\nTropical rain forest\nTemperate forest\nNorthern coniferous forest (taiga)\nSavanna\nAgricultural land\nWoodland and shrubland\nTemperate grassland\nTundra (arctic and alpine)\nDesert scrub\nExtreme desert\nAquatic Ecosystems\nEstuaries\nLakes and streams\nContinental shelf\nOpen oceanTerrestrial Ecosystems\n800 1,600 2,400 3,200 4,000 4,800 5,600 6,400 7,200 8,000 8,800 9,600\nAverage net primary productivity (kcal/m2/yr)\nFiGure 3  Estimated average annual net primary productivity in major life zones and ecosystems, in \nkilocalories of energy produced per square meter per year (kcal/m2/yr).\nCompiled by the authors using data from R.

Each atom con-sists of an extremely small and dense center called its nucleus,  \nwhich contains one or more protons and, in most cases, one or more neutrons, as well as one or more electrons moving rapidly somewhere around the nucleus (see Figure 2.4, p. 30). Each atom has equal numbers of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. Because these electrical charges cancel one another, atoms as a whole, in their simplest form, have no net electrical charge.We cannot determine the exact location of the electrons \naround any nucleus. Instead, we can estimate the probabil-ity that they will be found at various locations outside the nucleus\u2014sometimes called an electron probability cloud. This is somewhat like saying that there are six birds flying around inside a cloud. We do not know their exact location, but the cloud represents an area in which we can probably find them.\nMatter consists of elements and compounds (see Chap-\nter 2, pp. 29\u201330).\n Chemists have developed a way to classify \nthe elements according to their chemical behavior in what is called the Periodic Table of Elements (Figure 1).

Examples \nof metals are sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), silver (Ag), and mercury (Hg).\nAtoms of metals tend to lose one or more of their elec-\ntrons to form positively charged ions such as Na\n+, Ca2+, and \nAl3+. For example, an atom of the metallic element sodium \n(Na, atomic number 11) with 11 positively charged protons and 11 negatively charged electrons can lose one of its elec-trons. It then becomes a sodium ion with a positive charge of 1 (Na\n+) because it now has 11 positive charges (protons) but \nonly 10 negative charges (electrons).\nExamples of nonmetals are hydrogen (H), carbon (C), \nnitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), chlo-rine (Cl), and fluorine (F). Atoms of some nonmetals such as chlorine, oxygen, and sulfur tend to gain one or more elec-trons lost by metallic atoms to form negatively charged ions such as O\n2\u2212, S2\u2212, and Cl\u2212. For example, an atom of the non-\nmetallic element chlorine (Cl, atomic number 17) can gain an electron and become a chlorine ion. The ion has a negative charge of 1 (Cl\n\u2212) because it has 17 positively charged protons \nand 18 negatively charged electrons. Atoms of nonmetals can also combine with one another to form molecules in which they share one or more pairs of their electrons. Hydrogen, a nonmetal, is placed by itself above the center of the table because it does not fit very well into any of the groups.\nThe elements arranged in a diagonal staircase pat-\ntern between the metals and nonmetals have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties and are called metalloids. Examples are germanium (Ge) and arsenic (As).\nFigure 1 also identifies the elements required as nutrients \n(marked by small black squares) for all or some forms of life, and elements that are moderately or highly toxic (marked by small red squares) to all or most forms of life. Note that some elements such as copper (Cu) serve as nutrients, but can also be toxic at high enough doses. Six nonmetallic elements\u2014carbon (C), oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P)\u2014make up about 99% of the atoms of all living things.\nCONSIDER THIS\nTHINkINg ab OuT the periodic table\nUse the Periodic Table to identify, by name and symbol, two elements that \nshould have chemical properties similar to those of (a) Ca, (b) potassium,  (c) S, (d) lead.\nIonic and Covalent Bonds Hold  \nCompounds Together\nSodium chloride (NaCl) consists of a three-dimensional net-\nwork of oppositely charged ions (Na+ and Cl\u2212) held together \nby the forces of attraction between opposite charges (Figure 2). The strong forces of attraction between such oppositely charged ions are called ionic bonds. They are formed when an electron is transferred from a metallic atom such as sodium (Na) to a nonmetallic element such as chlorine (Cl). Because ionic compounds consist of ions formed from atoms of metal-lic elements (positive ions) and nonmetallic elements (nega-tive ions), they can be described as metal\u2013nonmetal compounds.\nSodium chloride and many other ionic compounds tend \nto dissolve in water and break apart into their individual ions (Figure 3).\n NaCl  \u2192 Na+ + Cl\u2212\nsodium chloride     sodium ion     chloride ion\n (in water)\nCl\u2013Na+\nFiGure 2  A solid crystal of an ionic compound such as sodium chlo-\nride consists of a three-dimensional array of", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3464, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dac42de2-9386-4e88-8e90-4335ad00656d": {"__data__": {"id_": "dac42de2-9386-4e88-8e90-4335ad00656d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "S6", "file_name": "G.

Each \nwater molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms chemically bonded to an oxygen atom, yielding H\n2O molecules. The \nbonds between the atoms in such molecules are called cova-lent bonds and form when the atoms in the molecule share one or more pairs of their electrons. Because they are formed from atoms of nonmetallic elements (Figure 1), covalent compounds can be described as nonmetal\u2013nonmetal compounds. Figure 4 shows the chemical formulas and shapes of the mol-ecules that are the building blocks for several common cova-lent compounds.\nWhat Makes Solutions Acidic? Hydrogen Ions \nand pH\nThe concentration, or number of hydrogen ions (H+) in a \nspecified volume of a solution (typically a liter), is a measure \nof its acidity. Pure water (not tap water or rainwater) has an equal number of hydrogen (H\n+) and hydroxide (OH\u2212) \nions. It is called a neutral solution. An acidic solution has more hydrogen ions than hydroxide ions per liter. A basic solution has more hydroxide ions than hydrogen ions per liter.Scientists use pH as a measure \nof the acidity of a solution based on its concentration of hydrogen ions (H\n+). By definition, a neutral solu-\ntion has a pH of 7, an acidic solution has a pH less than 7, and a basic solution has a pH greater than 7.\nEach single unit change in pH \nrepresents a tenfold increase or decrease in the concentration of hydrogen ions per liter. For example, an acidic solution with a pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 4. Figure 5 shows the approximate pH and hydrogen ion concentration per liter of solutions for various common substances.\nCONSIDER THIS\nTHINkINg ab OuT pH\nA solution has a pH of 2. How many times more acidic is this solution than one \nwith a pH of 6?\nThe measurement of acidity is important in the study of \nenvironmental science, as environmental changes involving \nacidity can have serious environmental impacts. For exam-ple, when coal and oil are burned, they give off acidic com-pounds that can return to the earth as acid deposition (see Fig-\nure 15.6, p. 394, and Figure 15.7, p. 395), which has become a major environmental problem.\nThere Are Weak Forces of Attraction between \nSome Molecules\nIonic and covalent bonds form between the ions or atoms \nwithin a compound. There are also weaker forces of attraction between the molecules of covalent compounds (such as water) resulting from an unequal sharing of electrons by two atoms.\nFor example, an oxygen atom has a much greater attrac-\ntion for electrons than does a hydrogen atom.

(Uracil, labeled U, occurs instead of thymine in RNA.) In the cells of living organisms, these nucleotide units combine in different numbers and sequences to form nucleic acids such as various types of DNA \nand RNA (Figure 10).\nHydrogen bonds formed between parts of the four nucle-\notides in DNA hold two DNA strands together like a spiral staircase, forming a double helix (Figure 10).

The three principal types of nuclear change are radioactive decay, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion. Compare chemical change, physical change.\nnuclear fission\n  Nuclear change in which \nthe nuclei of certain isotopes with large \nmass numbers (such as uranium-235 and \n plutonium-239) are split apart into lighter nuclei when struck by a neutron. This process releases more neutrons and a large amount of energy. Compare nuclear fusion.\nnuclear fuel cycle\n  Includes the mining of ura-\nnium, processing and enriching the uranium to \nmake fuel, using it in the reactor, safely stor-ing the resulting highly radioactive wastes for thousands of years until their radioactivity falls to safe levels, and retiring the highly radioac-tive plant by taking it apart and storing its high- and moderate-level radioactive material safely for thousands of years.\nnuclear fusion\n  Nuclear change in which two \nnuclei of isotopes of elements with a low mass \nnumber (such as hydrogen-2 and hydrogen-3) are forced together at extremely high tempera-tures until they fuse to form a heavier nucleus (such as helium-4). This process releases a large amount of energy. Compare nuclear fission.\nnucleic acid\n  Large polymer molecule made by \nlinking hundreds to thousands of four types \nof monomers called nucleotides. Two nucleic acids\u2014DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid)\u2014participate in the building of proteins and carry hereditary information used to pass traits from parent to offspring.\nnucleus\n  Extremely tiny center of an atom, \nmaking up most of the atom\u2019s mass. It contains \none or more positively charged protons and one or more neutrons with no electrical charge (except for a hydrogen-1 atom, which has one proton and no neutrons in its nucleus).\nnutrient\n  Any chemical that an organism must \ningest in order to live, grow, or reproduce.nutrient cycle\n  See biogeochemical cycle.\nnutrient cycling   The circulation of chemi-\ncals necessary for life, from the environment \n(mostly from soil and water) through organ-isms and back to the environment.\nocean acidification\n  The rising overall levels of \nacidity in ocean waters, occurring because the \noceans absorb about 25% of the CO2 emitted \ninto the atmosphere by human activities, espe-cially the burning of carbon-containing fossil fuels. The CO\n2 reacts with ocean water to form \na weak acid, which is having harmful effects on various aquatic species.ocean currents\n  Mass movements of surface \nwater produced by prevailing winds blowing over the oceans and shaped largely by conti-nental land forms.\noil sand\n  See tar sand.\nold-growth (primary) forest   Virgin and old, \nsecond-growth forests containing trees that are \noften hundreds\u2014sometimes thousands\u2014of years old.
